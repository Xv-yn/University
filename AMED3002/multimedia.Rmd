Testing for R Code

```{r setup}
setwd("~/Desktop/University/AMED3002/") # Set the working directory to wherever you data is
multideath <- read.csv("multideath.csv", fileEncoding = "latin1")
cancer_rates <- read.csv("cancerrates.csv")
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
cancer_subset <- cancer_rates %>%
  filter(
    Cancer_Type %in% c("Breast cancer", "Lung cancer", "Pancreatic cancer", "Prostate cancer", "Skin cancer")
  )

multi_subset <- multideath %>%
  filter(
    cause_of_death %in% c("Breast cancer (ICD-10 C50)", "Lung cancer (ICD-10 C33, C34)", "Pancreatic cancer (ICD-10 C25)", "Prostate cancer (ICD-10 C61)", "Skin cancer (ICD-10 C43, C44)")
  )

multi_subset$cause_of_death <- sapply(multi_subset$cause_of_death, 
                                       function(x) switch(as.character(x),
                                                          "Breast cancer (ICD-10 C50)" = "Breast cancer",
                                                          "Lung cancer (ICD-10 C33, C34)" = "Lung cancer",
                                                          "Pancreatic cancer (ICD-10 C25)" = "Pancreatic cancer",
                                                          "Prostate cancer (ICD-10 C61)" = "Prostate cancer",
                                                          "Skin cancer (ICD-10 C43, C44)" = "Skin cancer")
                                      )

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
subset <- cancer_rates %>%
  filter(
    Cancer_Type == "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia",
    Sex == "Male",
    !is.na(Age_0_to_4)
  )
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(subset, aes(x = Year, y = Age_0_to_4, group = Type, color = Type)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (Age 0â€“4, Male)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Cases") 
  # facet_wrap(~ subset$Type)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

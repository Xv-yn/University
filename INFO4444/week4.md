# Open and Closed Innovation

## The "Innovation Funnel"
Traditionally:

3,000 Raw Ideas > 300 Submitted Ideas > 125 Small Projects > 
4 Major Developments > 2 Launches > 1 Successful New Product

Now it's a lot easier!

## Open Innovation
Everything is public!
- Ideas come from anywhere
- Low Risk
- Donation Dependent
- Less Manpower
- Lack of Control

## Closed Innovation
Everything is kept within a company
- Higher Funding
- High Risk
- More Manpower
- Ideas come from anywhere
- Absolute Control

## Distributed Innovation

### Modularity

Using an existing product, let's say ChatGPT's 4o model, and splitting
it into smaller segments, such as its API.

This can also be seen in Microsoft Office plug-ins.

# Product Platforms and Web APIs

Product Platforms are the "core" of an innovation. The "platform"/foundation
on which the innovation is built or a company that build related products.

Let's say Google Chrome. It allows for Chrome Extensions, which taylor 
the functionality to everyone's unique needs.

By re-using certain technologies in Chrome, it allows for faster development,
while also having higher adaptability at a lower range cost.

Part of it is opensource, allowing for innovation as well. It also allows
others to create their own plug-ins for others to use.

## Web APIs
This is basically a function that we can use, but not know its inner workings.

The company lets us use their functions, but wont tell us how it works, so
in most cases, an active internet connection is always needed.

These are extremely profitable because if the functions are good enough they
can be used for anything.


# Crowdsourcing and Crowdfunding
## Crowdsourcing
This is basically saying, "I don't know how to do this part" and asking
people on the interne for help. This requires people from the public to
voluntarily help and provide their expertise on the subject and they get
a reward!

A generalized step-by-step process:
1. Company has a problem
2. Company Broadcasts Problem Online
3. Crowds asked to give solutions
4. Crowd submits solutions
5. Crowd vets solution
6. Company rewards winning solvers
7. Company owns winning solution
8. Company Profits

## Crowdfunding

This is basically kickstarter. 
"Hey I have an idea on how to make this product and I need money".

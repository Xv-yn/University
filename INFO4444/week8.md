# Commercialization

## Startups

In early stages, startups generally start as an informal company:
- A group of people/Single person
- Build a prototype 
- Talk to users 
- Test the market 
- Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

However, in later stages, they do require 
- a registered business name
- tax ID
- legal structure

## Currently Used Startup Methodology
Combines: 
- Customer Development (Steve Blank): Get out of the building, test assumptions 
- Agile Development: Iterative, incremental, feedback-driven 
- Business Model Canvas: Visual framework to test business ideas


## Traditional Established Company Methodology
Assumes too much upfront:
- Knows customer needs
- Has all correct features
- Can predict launch success

Fails to incorporate testing, learning, and iteration

### General Process
1. State your hypotheses
2. Test with customers (Customer Discovery)
3. Verify hypotheses (Customer Validation)
4. Scale up (Customer Creation)
5. Transition to a company (Company Building)


## The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Definition: A version of the product that enables maximum learning with 
            minimal effort

Purpose: Validate assumptions with real users before scaling

Examples: Uber, Spotify, Airbnb, inDriver

## Product-Market Fit

Happens when your product satisfies a strong market demand

Indicators of poor fit:
- Low user engagement
- Long sales cycles
- Lack of word-of-mouth

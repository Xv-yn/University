# Diffusion of Innovation
Diffusion is the process in which an innovation is communicated through 
certain channels over time among the members of a social system.

Simply put, its the adaptation of a new technology into a society.
E.g. before phones, mail was used, now phones (new technology) are 
     everywhere.

## Technology Adaptation Model
Literally a bell curve

## The Chasm
Not many products can cross this chasm
It is extremely challenging to get from early adoption to mainstream

                     THE CHASM
```

Things to consider in order to cross the chasm:
1.Narrowing the focus (Target a niche first)
    Example: Tesla initially targeted the luxury EV market before expanding 
             to mass-market vehicles.
2.Positioning the product as a practical solution
    Example: Cloud computing services gained traction in businesses after 
             case studies showed cost savings and scalability.
3.Building a strong reference base
    Example: Microsoft’s Windows OS gained credibility when IBM adopted it 
             for PCs.
4.Developing a complete product (not just an innovation)
    Example: Smartphones only went mainstream after app ecosystems, security 
             updates, and seamless connectivity improved.
5.Using a “Bowling Alley” strategy
    Example: Amazon started with books, then expanded into electronics, 
             cloud computing (AWS), and more.

# Diffusion of Innovation
Diffusion is the process in which an innovation is communicated through 
certain channels over time among the members of a social system.

Simply put, its the adaptation of a new technology into a society.
E.g. before phones, mail was used, now phones (new technology) are 
     everywhere.

## Technology Adaptation Model
Literally a bell curve

## The Chasm
Not many products can cross this chasm
It is extremely challenging to get from early adoption to mainstream

                     THE CHASM
```

Things to consider in order to cross the chasm:
1.Narrowing the focus (Target a niche first)
    Example: Tesla initially targeted the luxury EV market before expanding 
             to mass-market vehicles.
2.Positioning the product as a practical solution
    Example: Cloud computing services gained traction in businesses after 
             case studies showed cost savings and scalability.
3.Building a strong reference base
    Example: Microsoft’s Windows OS gained credibility when IBM adopted it 
             for PCs.
4.Developing a complete product (not just an innovation)
    Example: Smartphones only went mainstream after app ecosystems, security 
             updates, and seamless connectivity improved.
5.Using a “Bowling Alley” strategy
    Example: Amazon started with books, then expanded into electronics, 
             cloud computing (AWS), and more.

Example: Amazon Alexa
        1. It seemed like a perfect AI
        2. It was fun to use
        3. Realized that it was only really used for music and lights
        4. Acceptance

## Design Dominance

### Uncertainty Phase
1. A first new product is introduced, _usually_ "Made To Order"
2. If it attracts enough marketshare, it forces imitation
3. Competitors products are released
4. Cost reduction pressure on companies to get cheaper components

### Fluidity Phase
5. A dominant design is developed by either the original or competitors
   that meets certain standards
6. The dominant design becomes the base for the industry
7. The dominant design can become the "standard"
    - Ensures quality
    - Compatibility

### Reasons for Selection
1. Learning Effects
    - Easy to use
    - Increase productivity
2. Network Effects
    - increased number of product -> increased number of users -> 
      increased number of product -> ...

### First, Second, Fast Second
1. First Mover
    - Their product may become the dominant design
2. Second Mover
    - Basically a product clone
    - BUT, drives cost/pricing competition
3. Fast Second
    - Potentially creates the dominant design or help create it
    - Attempts to lead the market
    - Timing - has to be ready to move as the first mover

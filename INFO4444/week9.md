# Commercialization Part 2

## General Idea (Value Proposition Canvas)

The first thing we need to know when commercializing anything is to know 2
main things.

1. Who is the customer?
2. What does this product/item do? (What value does it have?)

Customers get excited when products:
- Address important jobs
- Alleviate extreme pains, and
- Create essential gains that customers care about

## Customer Profile

When determining the customer, we want to know 3 things:

1. Customer Jobs: 
   What customers are trying to get done in their work and in their lives, 
   as expressed in their own words

    - Functional Jobs
        - Jobs that complete a certain task (phones for calling)
    - Social Jobs
        - Jobs that make the customer look good (branded items)
    - Personal & Emotional Jobs
        - Jobs that make the customer feel a certain emotional state 
        (horror games)

2. Gains: 
   The outcomes customers want to achieve or the concrete benefits they are 
   seeking 

    - Required Gains
        - This is a non-negotiable item. The product/item MUST do this 
          non-negotiable action/thing
    - Expected Gains
        - This is the standard expectations that users assume will be there. 
        - The solution might technically work without them, but customers 
          would feel it's lacking
    - Desired Gains
        - These go beyond what we need, and are nice to have but do not 
          necessarily need
    - Unexpected Gains
        - Gains that go beyond customer expectations and desires. 
          They wouldnâ€™t even come up with them if you asked them

3. Pains: 
  bad outcomes, risks and obstacles related to the customer jobs

    - Undesired outcomes, problems and characteristics
        - negative results or unpleasant aspects a customer wants to avoid 
          when using a product or service.
    - Obstacles
        - barriers or hurdles that prevent the customer from starting, progressing, 
          or succeeding with a task.
    - Risks
        - what might go wrong in the future and cause serious negative consequences.

## Value Map

The value map shows what value your product provides.

1. Product offering and its associated features.
    - What your product does
    - What features your product has
    - Categories of Offerings:
        - Digital (Minecraft)
        - Physical (Jewelry)
        - Intangible (Music Royalty)
        - Financial (Stocks)
2. Gain Creators: how the product offering creates customer gains 
    - How the product intends to produce outcomes and benefits that your 
      customer expects, desires, or would be surprised by
3. Pain Relievers: how the product offering alleviate customer pains
    - How the product intends to eliminate or reduce some of the things that 
      annoy your customers before, during or after they are trying to 
      complete a job or that prevent them from doing so

# Structure of the Genitourinary System

- Female Genitourinary System
  - Reproductive organs
    - Ovaries: Produce eggs (ova) and hormones (estrogen, progesterone).
    - Fallopian tubes: Carry eggs from ovary to uterus.
    - Uterus: Muscular organ where a fertilized egg implants and develops.
    - Cervix: Lower part of the uterus opening into the vagina.
    - Vagina: Muscular canal leading from cervix to external opening.
    - Clitoris: Erectile tissue, highly sensitive, part of external genitalia.
    - G-spot/fornix: Regions associated with sexual sensitivity inside the vagina.
  - Urinary organs
    - Bladder: Stores urine.
    - Urethra: Narrow tube that carries urine out of the body (short in females,
      so more prone to UTIs).
  - Other nearby structures
    - Rectum & anus: Digestive tract components close to the reproductive system.
    - Pubic bone: Part of the pelvis, provides support.
    - Sigmoid colon: Segment of the large intestine near uterus and bladder.

- Male Genitourinary System
  - Reproductive organs
    - Testes: Produce sperm and testosterone.
    - Epididymis: Coiled tube where sperm mature and are stored.
    - Vas deferens: Tube carrying sperm from epididymis toward urethra.
    - Seminal vesicles: Add fluid (rich in sugars) to nourish sperm.
    - Prostate gland: Adds fluid that helps sperm mobility and survival.
    - Cowper’s (bulbourethral) glands: Secrete mucus for lubrication.
    - Penis: Organ for copulation and passage of urine/semen.
    - Corpus cavernosum: Erectile tissue that fills with blood during arousal.
    - Glans & foreskin: Sensitive tip of penis, with protective covering (foreskin).
  - Urinary organs
    - Bladder: Stores urine.
    - Urethra: Shared pathway for urine and semen, passes through the penis.
  - Other nearby structures
    - Rectum & anus: Digestive tract components behind the bladder and prostate.
    - Sigmoid colon: Large intestine segment near bladder and prostate.
    - Scrotum: Sac holding the testes, regulating temperature for sperm production.

# Comparing Male vs. Female Reproductive Tracts and Infection Risks

1. Urethra Length
   - Female: Shorter urethra → pathogens (e.g., E. coli) reach bladder more easily →
     higher risk of UTIs.
   - Male: Longer urethra → more protection from ascending infections → lower UTI
     rates.

2. Urethral Location
   - Female: Urethra is close to the anus → increased chance of fecal contamination →
     common cause of UTIs.
   - Male: Greater distance from anus → less contamination risk.

3. Genital pH
   - Female: Acidic vaginal environment → protective against many bacteria but
     promotes yeast overgrowth → higher rates of yeast infections (Candida).
   - Male: Neutral genital environment → doesn’t favor acid-loving pathogens but also
     lacks the protective acidic barrier → different infection profile.

4. Moisture Levels
   - Female: Higher warmth + moisture → supports both commensal flora (like
     Lactobacillus) and pathogenic microbes (e.g., yeast, Gardnerella).
   - Male: Generally drier, which reduces microbial growth; exception in
     uncircumcised males where foreskin retains moisture → higher risk of balanitis
     and STIs.

5. Hormonal Influence
   - Female: Hormonal fluctuations (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause) → shifts
     in vaginal flora → increased vaginosis, yeast infections, and UTI susceptibility.
   - Male: Hormonal environment is more stable → microbial flora less affected →
     lower infection variability.

6. External Exposure
   - Female: Internal structures (vagina, cervix, uterus) are directly exposed during
     intercourse, increasing risk of STIs (e.g., Chlamydia, HPV, Gonorrhea).
   - Male: External genitalia are less exposed internally, lowering susceptibility,
     but foreskin (if present) can trap pathogens → circumcision reduces some STI
     risks.

# Normal Microbiota in the Genitourinary System

- Male Reproductive/Urinary Tract Microbiota
  - Characteristics:
    - Very low numbers of normal microbiota.
    - Urine flushing → bladder and urethra are kept relatively sterile.
    - In healthy males, microbiota are mostly skin-derived microbes (e.g.,
      Staphylococcus species).
  - Importance:
    - Fewer microbes mean lower colonization risk.
    - But also less protective flora, so infections (when they do happen) often
      come from external introduction (e.g., STIs, catheters).

- Female Reproductive/Urinary Tract Microbiota
  - Characteristics:
    - Complex and dynamic microbiota (changes with hormones, age, menstrual cycle).
    - Dominated by Lactobacillus species in healthy women.
  - Protective Roles of Lactobacillus:
    - Acidic environment (low pH) → lactic acid production inhibits many pathogens.
    - Bacteriocins → antimicrobial peptides that kill competing bacteria.
    - Competition for nutrients and binding sites → prevents overgrowth of harmful
      microbes.
  - Importance:
    - Acts as a non-specific defense system against pathogens.
    - Disruption (e.g., antibiotics, hormonal changes) can lead to bacterial
      vaginosis, yeast infections, or increased susceptibility to STIs.

# Major Sexually Transmitted Pathogens

## Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gonorrhoea)

- Overview
  - Gram-negative diplococci bacteria.
  - Causes gonorrhoea, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), urethritis.
  - ~82 million cases globally (2020).
  - Major public health concern due to antimicrobial resistance.

- Epidemiology
  - One of the most common STIs worldwide.
  - Transmitted by sexual contact (penis, vagina, mouth, anus) or perinatally from
    mother to child.
  - Often asymptomatic, especially in women → silent spread.

- Biology & Virulence Factors
  - No polysaccharide capsule (unlike N. meningitidis).
  - LOS (lipooligosaccharide) → endotoxin → strong inflammation, septic shock risk.
  - Type IV pili → adhesion & invasion, undergo antigenic variation → repeated
    infections.
  - IgA protease → degrades IgA, aids mucosal adherence.
  - PorB protein → binds complement regulators (C4BP, Factor H) → evades immune
    recognition.
  - Natural transformer → takes up DNA from environment → acquires resistance genes.

- Clinical Features
  - Males: penile discharge (purulent), pain on urination, anal discomfort,
    conjunctivitis.
  - Females: vaginal discharge, irregular bleeding, pain on urination, pelvic pain
    (esp. during sex), risk of PID.
  - Newborns: conjunctivitis during childbirth.
  - Can infect urethra, cervix, throat, anus, eyes.
  - Increases susceptibility to HIV infection.

- Why No Vaccine?
  - Antigenic variation of pili and Opa proteins → immune system can’t generate
    lasting protection.
  - Contrast: N. meningitidis (meningococcal) has stable capsule antigens → vaccines
    possible.

- Treatment & Resistance
  - Treatable with antibiotics: ceftriaxone, azithromycin.
  - Resistance is a serious global issue:
  - 1980s → Penicillin & tetracycline no longer effective.
  - 2007 → Ciprofloxacin dropped.
  - 2012 → Cefixime no longer recommended.
  - Now → ceftriaxone + azithromycin (dual therapy).

- Resistance driven by:
  - Nature of pathogen → high genetic plasticity, horizontal gene transfer.
  - Host behavior → high prevalence, untreated asymptomatic carriers, misuse of
    antibiotics.

## Chlamydia trachomatis

- Overview
  - Type: Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterial parasite.
  - Global burden: ~129 million cases annually (2020), one of the most common STIs
    worldwide.
  - Most reported communicable disease in Australia.

- Biological Features
  - Obligate intracellular → cannot grow outside host cells.
  - Cell wall features: lacks muramic acid → very little peptidoglycan → resistant
    to β-lactam antibiotics.
  - Host-dependent: relies on host for ATP, amino acids, nucleotides.
  - Primary sites of infection: genitourinary tract + conjunctiva.
  - Transmission: Sexual contact, or perinatal (mother → child).

- Life Cycle
  - Has a virus-like cycle with two forms:
    - Elementary Body (EB)
      - Infectious form, small & dense, metabolically inactive.
      - Survives outside cells, attaches to host, enters via endocytosis.
    - Reticulate Body (RB)
      - Larger, metabolically active, replicates inside host cell.
      - Converts back into EB for release and spread.
  - Type III secretion system:
    - Delivers effector proteins into host cell → helps survival, remodeling, and
      immune evasion.
    - TARP: remodels host cytoskeleton.
    - Pgp3: immune evasion, also used as a diagnostic marker for past infection.

- Clinical Aspects
  - Diseases:
    - Urethritis (men).
    - Cervicitis, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) in women.
    - Infertility due to tubal scarring.
    - Conjunctivitis & pneumonia in newborns (perinatal).
  - Symptoms: Often asymptomatic (silent epidemic) → up to 70% of women, many men
    too.
    - When present: watery discharge, dysuria, pelvic pain.

- Treatment & Resistance
  - Treatable with antibiotics:
    - Azithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin (protein synthesis inhibitors).
  - Resistance: Not yet common but increasing.

## Treponema pallidum (Syphilis)

- Overview
  - Gram-negative spirochete, too thin to be seen under light microscopy → requires
    dark field microscopy.
  - Reduced genome (~1.14 Mb) → high host dependency.
  - Extracellular pathogen.
  - Motile spiral shape using outer sheath for movement.
  - Transmission: sexual contact, mother-to-child (congenital syphilis), higher risk
    in HIV+ individuals.

- Disease Stages
  - Primary Syphilis
    - Highly contagious.
    - Localised infection with painless chancre at entry site.
    - Chancre heals spontaneously but bacteria persist.
  - Secondary Syphilis
    - Disseminated infection, systemic rash (non-purulent), often on palms and
      soles.
    - Still highly contagious.
  - Latent Stage
    - Positive serology but asymptomatic.
    - WHO considers latent stage still potentially transmissible.
  - Tertiary Syphilis
    - Years later if untreated.
    - Gummas (necrotising granulomas).
    - Can spread to CNS → neurologic & psychological issues.
  - Cardiovascular syphilis also possible.

- Virulence Factors
  - Shape & Motility → rapid dissemination, CNS invasion within weeks.
  - Outer membrane sheath:
    - Masks immune recognition.
    - Very low PAMP expression (~100x fewer than typical Gram-negative bacteria).
  - TprK protein:
    - Surface antigen with variation, aids immune evasion and persistence.

- Treatment
  - Benzathine benzylpenicillin = gold standard (inhibits cell wall synthesis).
  - Global shortage of Bicillin-LA has increased incidence.
  - Antimicrobial resistance rare, but cases increasing.

## Trichomonas vaginalis (Trichomoniasis)

- Overview
  - Anaerobic, flagellated protozoan (motile).
  - Infects genital epithelial cells.
  - Transmission: sexual contact.
  - ~70% infections are asymptomatic (silent carriers).
  - Can cause pregnancy complications → preterm delivery, low birth weight.

- Virulence Factors
  - Adhesins (AP65, AP51, AP33):
    - Mediate adherence, immune evasion, cytotoxicity.
  - Protease CP65:
    - Degrades tissue, triggers inflammation → green frothy discharge (vs
      bacterial vaginosis which is grey-white).
  - Tissue damage → spotting, bleeding post-intercourse.
  - Dysbiosis:
    - Disrupts protective vaginal flora (esp. Lactobacillus), worsening infection.

- Identification
  - In males: usually symptomatic, can ascend → urethritis.
  - Testing:
    - Vaginal pH > 4.5 (indicative).
    - Wet mount microscopy for motile protozoa.

- Treatment
  - Metronidazole (single dose) → effective.
  - Antimicrobial resistance not common, but cases increasing.

# Pathogenesis of Herpes Simplex Virus-1/2 (HSV1 and HSV2)

1. Primary Infection
   - Entry: Virus enters through a break in the skin or mucosa (oral/genital mucosa).
   - Target cells: Epithelial cells.
   - Replication: Viral DNA enters the host cell nucleus → genome replication,
     transcription, and translation occur → new virions are assembled.
   - Spread: Newly produced virions are released and infect nearby epithelial cells
     and sensory nerve endings.
   - Symptoms: Painful lesions (cold sores, genital ulcers) during primary infection.
     Sometimes asymptomatic.

2. Latency
   - After the initial infection, HSV travels via retrograde axonal transport to
     sensory neurons (e.g., trigeminal ganglia for HSV-1, sacral ganglia for HSV-2).
   - Viral genome persists in a non-replicating, episomal state (not integrated into
     host DNA).
   - No viral proteins or virions are produced → virus remains hidden from immune
     surveillance.

3. Reactivation
   - Triggers include stress, illness, UV exposure, immunosuppression.
   - Virus reactivates from the latent state in neurons.
   - Travels back via anterograde transport to the epithelial cells.
   - Replicates again, producing infectious virions.
   - Causes recurrent lesions at or near the original site of infection (cold sores,
     genital sores).

4. Clinical Features
   - HSV-1: More commonly oral (cold sores), but can also cause genital infections.
   - HSV-2: More commonly genital, but both types overlap.
   - Both cause painful recurrent lesions.
   - Establishes lifelong infection — virus never fully cleared from sensory neurons.

## Key Points

HSV’s ability to:

- Establish latency in neurons,
- Avoid immune detection during latency,
- Reactivate repeatedly,

explains why herpes is a lifelong infection with recurrent episodes.

# Transmission of Genital Herpes

- Transmission Routes
  - Sexual contact:
    - Vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
    - Oral-genital contact can spread HSV-1 to the genitals.
  - Asymptomatic shedding:
    - Even without visible sores, the virus can shed from the skin or mucosa.
    - This is a major driver of transmission because most people don’t realize
      they’re infected.
  - Higher prevalence in females:
    - The female genital tract is more permissive to infection, making women more
      susceptible.

- Timing and Symptoms
  - Only 10–25% of infected individuals are aware they have the infection.
  - Blisters/lesions appear ~4–12 days after transmission:
    - Painful, itchy, burning vesicles.
    - May be accompanied by flu-like symptoms.
  - Lesions increase susceptibility to HIV transmission (due to mucosal disruption).

- Reactivation & Infectivity
  - Virus establishes latency in sensory neurons → can reactivate and shed again.
  - Reactivation events are most frequent early on (e.g., ~5 times/year in the first
    year for HSV-2), but decrease with time.

# Prevention, Control and Treatment

1. Prevention Strategies
   - Education & Awareness
     - Comprehensive education about STIs (modes of transmission, symptoms, risks).
     - Counseling and support, particularly for at-risk groups (youth, MSM, sex
       workers).
   - Barrier Methods
     - Consistent use of condoms reduces transmission of bacterial, viral, and
       protozoan STIs.
     - Promotion of safe sex practices and reduction of multiple partners.
   - Screening & Early Diagnosis
     - Routine testing of sexually active individuals (especially for Chlamydia and
       Gonorrhea).
     - Asymptomatic infections are common, so screening helps reduce hidden spread.
   - Vaccines
     - Currently, no vaccines for bacterial or protozoan STIs.
     - HPV vaccine exists (prevents cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers).
     - Research ongoing for vaccines against chlamydia, gonorrhea, HSV.

2. Control Strategies After Infection
   - Destigmatization
     - Stigma around STIs discourages testing and treatment → community education
       is crucial.
   - Partner Notification & Treatment
     - Sexual partners must also be tested and treated to prevent reinfection
       (“ping-pong” effect).
   - Public Health Measures
     - Mandatory reporting of certain STIs (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia).
     - Contact tracing and surveillance programs.
   - Access to Healthcare
     - Affordable, timely, and effective treatment is essential for control.
     - Outreach clinics in at-risk communities improve outcomes.

3. Treatment by Pathogen

- Chlamydia trachomatis
  - Antibiotics: azithromycin, doxycycline.
  - Resistance rare but emerging.

- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
  - Treatment: ceftriaxone (plus azithromycin previously, but resistance rising).
  - Major global concern: multidrug-resistant gonorrhea.

- Treponema pallidum (Syphilis)
  - Penicillin (benzathine benzylpenicillin).
  - Resistance not common, but drug shortages are increasing incidence.

- Trichomonas vaginalis
  - Metronidazole (single dose).
  - Resistance rare but increasing.

- Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1/2)
  - No cure (lifelong infection).
  - Antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir) reduce symptoms and shedding.
  - Prevention: condoms, avoiding sex during outbreaks, education.

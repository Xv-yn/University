# Treponema pallidum Infection Strategy

1. Exposure & Entry
   - Passed by sexual contact (genital, oral-genital less common).
   - Exists only as a motile trophozoite (no cyst stage), so it must be transferred directly
     into the urogenital tract (vagina, cervix, urethra).

2. Initial Survival
   - Trophozoites settle into mucosal secretions and start moving with their
     flagella/undulating membrane.
   - Because there’s no cyst, organisms die quickly outside the host—transmission depends on
     direct contact.

3. Attachment (start of colonization)
   - Parasite adhesion proteins bind tightly to epithelial cells (vaginal/cervical or urethral).
   - Firm attachment is essential; unattached parasites are cleared more easily.

4. Contact-Dependent Damage (“leech with corrosive saliva”)
   - While attached, the parasite releases proteases and pore-forming factors that injure membranes.
   - Epithelial cells round, detach, and can lyse.
   - The parasite ingests cell fragments, lipids, and nutrients (plus local bacteria) right
     at the surface.

5. Replication
   - Simple binary fission of trophozoites on the mucosal surface.
   - No intracellular phase, no systemic spread—localized proliferation at the site.

6. Inflammation → Symptoms
   - Epithelial injury + parasite products trigger local inflammation.
   - Typical outcomes in women: frothy, malodorous discharge, itching/irritation, dyspareunia;
     classic “strawberry cervix” (punctate hemorrhages) can appear.
   - In men: often asymptomatic or urethritis/dysuria.

7. Consequences
   - Ongoing epithelial disruption can increase susceptibility to other STIs (e.g., HIV) and
     is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   - Because there’s no systemic phase, complications are chiefly local mucosal damage and
     inflammation.

8. Ongoing Transmission
   - Large numbers of trophozoites are shed in genital secretions → passed to partners during sex,
     perpetuating the cycle.

## Immune Evasion

- Antigenic variation of surface molecules → avoids antibody recognition.

- Adsorbs host proteins (camouflage) and interferes with complement to reduce killing.

- Net effect: it stays stuck to mucosa, feeding and irritating without being quickly cleared.

# Immune Response to Treponema pallidum

## Innate Immune Response (First Responders)

1. Epithelial Cell Alarm
   - Epithelial cells recognize T. vaginalis surface molecules via pattern recognition
     receptors (PRRs).
   - They release cytokines like IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, which attract immune cells.

2. Neutrophils
   - Large numbers of neutrophils are recruited.
   - They can damage and kill parasites using ROS, enzymes, and extracellular traps.
   - But T. vaginalis resists killing by binding complement and secreting antioxidant enzymes.

3. Macrophages
   - Phagocytose some trophozoites and release more cytokines.
   - T. vaginalis can damage macrophages directly with its proteases.

4. Complement System
   - Normally kills pathogens by membrane attack complex.
   - T. vaginalis evades this by coating itself in host proteins (like albumin,
     immunoglobulins) and expressing surface proteins that inactivate complement.

## Adaptive Immune Response (Specific Defenders)

1. Antibody Response (B cells)
   - IgA and IgG form against parasite surface antigens.
   - Antibodies can block adhesion and help complement.
   - But:
     - Parasite undergoes antigenic variation of surface proteins.
     - Constantly shedding/changing its “coat” makes antibodies short-lived in effect.

2. T-cell Response
   - CD4+ T cells (Th1 and Th17) → produce IFN-γ and IL-17, which activate macrophages
     and recruit neutrophils.
   - CD8+ T cells are less important since parasite is extracellular.
   - Parasite can induce apoptosis of T cells with secreted factors, dampening response.

# Micro Organisms

Simplest terms – an organism that is too small to be seen with the naked eye.

# Types of Micro Organisms

- Cellular
  - Fungi
  - Protists
  - Bacteria
  - Archaea
- Acellular
  - Viruses
  - Viroids
  - Satellites
  - Prions

> [!NOTE]
> There is no black and white difference between Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes

**Fungi** and **Protists** have membrane bound organelles

**Bacteria** do **not** have membrane bound organelles

Archaea have features common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and there is currently
no known pathogenic species

# Gram Stains

1. Crystal violet dye is applied → it enters all bacterial cells.
2. Iodine is added → forms a crystal violet–iodine complex inside the cell.
3. Alcohol/acetone wash:
   - Gram-positive: Thick peptidoglycan cell wall holds onto the purple dye.
   - Gram-negative: Thin peptidoglycan + outer membrane → alcohol dissolves the
     outer membrane, purple dye washes out.
4. Safranin counterstain:
   - Gram-positive remain purple (retain crystal violet).
   - Gram-negative become pink/red (take up safranin).

## Key Differences

|       Feature       |  Gram-Positive   |       Gram-Negative       |
| :-----------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Peptidoglycan layer | Thick (20–80 nm) |       Thin (2–7 nm)       |
|   Outer membrane    |        No        | Yes (lipopolysaccharides) |
|    Stain result     |      Purple      |         Pink/red          |

# Bacteria (Prokaryotes)

- Single-celled organism
- Generally <10 μM in size
- Cell wall contains peptidoglycan
- Lack membrane bound organelles

# Fungi (Eukaryotes)

- Yeast
  - Single-celled fungi
  - Saccharomyces cerevisae
  - Utilised by humans for thousands of years
  - Candida spp.
- Moulds
  - Filamentous fungi
  - Penicillium spp.
- Majority of pathogenic fungi are opportunistic

# Protists (everything else)

- Algae
  - Photosynthetic
  - Produce ~75% of the planet’s oxygen
  - Can be pathogenic
- Protozoa
  - Unicellular animal-like organisms
  - Plasmodium spp.
- Slime moulds
  - Behave like both protozoa and fungi across lifecycle

# Symbiosis = Living together of organisms

- Spectrum of host/microbe associations
- One organism lives in/on body of another

- Parasitism
- Mutualism
  - human microbiota
    - Compete with pathogens for attachment sites, nutrients
    - Produce antimicrobial compounds = toxic to invaders, pathogens
    - Aid digestion
    - Supply essential growth requirements
    - Stimulate immune system
  - Some normal microbiota may become pathogens if the “opportunity” arises.
- Commensalism

Often infections/diseases occur when a microorganism isable to take advantage of an
"opportunity”, eg. altered immune status.

# Making a Pathogen

- A complex interactive process
- Virulence is the outcome of a specific host-pathogen interaction
- The host and the wider ecological context (holobiont) play a role in determining
  whether an organism is pathogenic
- The immune response can sometimes do more harm than the invading agents, or at least
  actively takes part in the harm caused
- Pathogens lack structures unique to them that would set them apart from commensals
  unambiguously

## The environment of the genitourinary system

- Consists of both urinary and reproductive systems (aka urogenital system)
- Distinct differences in male and female reproductive system including the amount
  and types of microorganisms that comprise the normal microbiota.
- Microbiota of the female reproductive system responsible for low pH in vagina
  which plays a role in protecting against infections

## The environment of the respiratory tract

- Upper RT (nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx) is microbe dense, more available
  nutrients, lower temperature (ambient), humidity & pH
- Lower RT (trachea, lungs) nutrient poor, higher temperature (37 C), humidity & pH

## The environment of the gastrointestinal tract

- Moist, constant 37 C, nutrient rich
- Large variation in pH
- Very diverse microbiome
- Shown to have far reaching effects on many aspects of our wellbeing.

## The environment of the skin

- Can be dry (forearm), moist (axilla) or oily (forehead)
- Variable temperature, depends upon body location and ambient temperature
- Transient microbes
- Secretions from sweat and oil glands which have

# Viruses

Viruses are not regarded as a true living organism purely because they are
incapable of making more viruses on their own without help from a host.

Viruses:

- Are **not** made of cells
- Can **not** reproduce on their own
- Do **not** undergo division
- Lack "machinery" for protein synthesis
  - No nucleus
  - No mitochondria
  - no ER
  - No golgi
  - No ribosomes

Viruses are extremely small to "see" a viral particle, an electron
microscope MUST be used.

## Structure fo a Virus

- Viruses have a nucleic acid genome or either DNA or RNA
- Viral genome encode the genetic information to make virus copies
  - Like a fork bomb script
- The nucleic acid is surrounded by a protective **protein coat** called
  a capsid
- In **some** viruses, there is an outer membranous layer called an
  **envelope**

> [!NOTE]
> Viruses with an envelope are called 'envelope viruses'
>
> Viruses without an envelope are called 'non-envelope viruses' or
> 'naked viruses'

## Viral Infections

### Portals of Entry

- Skin
- Respiratory Tract
- Gastrointestinal Tract
- Genitourinary Tract
- Conjunctiva

### Spread of Virus Within Host

- Localized Infection
  - Virus starts replicating at primary site of infection
    - Produces more viruses
    - Releases the produced viruses outside the cell (shedding to exterior)
  - Only spreads to adjacent cells
  - Examples:
    - Respiratory Infections
      - Influenza
      - Rhinovirus
    - Gastrointestinal Infections
      - Potaviruses
    - Skin Infections
      - Papilomaviruses

- Disseminated Infection
  - Must breach physical and immunological barriers
  - Extends beyond primary site of infection
  - Viruses move via circulatory system
    - Directly through capillaries vai bite or puncture
    - Can invade organs via blood vessels
    - Examples:
      - HIV
        - T Lymphocytes
        - Monocytes
      - EBV
        - B Lymphocytes
      - Measles
        - Monocytes
      - VZV
        - T Lymphocytes
  - Viruses can also move via the nervous system
    - Enters the sensory or motor nerve endings
    - Sensory
      - Dorsal Root Ganglia
    - Motor
      - Motor Neurons

- Systemic Infection
  - Affects many organs

> [!NOTE]
> When the virus moves out of the primary site they literally need to move
> to the preferred site of replication

### Immune Response

- Innate Immunity
  - First line of defence
    - Skin
    - Mucous Membranes
    - Gastric Acids
  - Second line of defence
    - Natural Killer Cells
    - Macrophages
    - Eosinophils
    - Cytokines
- Adaptive Immunity
  - Third line of defence
    - T-cells
      - Cell Killing
      - Cytokines
    - B-cells
      - Antibody Production

### Types of Infections

- Acute Infections
  - Rapid production of infectious virions
  - Rapid resolution and elimintation of infection
  - Examples:
    - Rhinovirus
    - Rotavirus
    - Influenza Virus
  - Usually brief in immunocompetent (normal) hosts
  - Virions and infected cells are completely cleared by immune response

- Persistent Infection
  - Not cleared effectively by the immune response
  - Virus particles or products continue to be produced for long periods
  - Two main types:
    - Slow/Chronic
      - Measles SSPE
      - HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)
    - Latent
  - Virus can periodically reawaken from latency
    - This process is called reactivation
  - Reactivation leads to new infection virus with/without disease
  - Herpes viruses are characterized by their capacity to establish a latent
    infection

## Virus Spreading

Transmission is dependent on:

- The number of virsu particles shed
- Number of virus particles required to infect a new host
- Stability of virus in the environemnt (how long can it live outside the host)

These are the methods in which a virus can spread:

- Transmission via Aerosols
  - Some of the most "popular" viruses spread via aerosols droplets (sneezing
    and coughing)
  - Example:
    - Influenza Virus
    - Corona Virus
    - Rhino Virus
    - Adeno Virus

- Faecal-Oral Transmission
  - There is usually alot of virus shed (virus particles) in watery diarrhoea
    and vomiting associated with viral gasroenteritis
  - Because of this it can spread via:
    - Shellfish harvested in contaminated areas
    - Any contact with contaminated surfaces
    - Contaminated food (even a drop)
  - Examples:
    - Hep A
    - Poliovirus
    - Hep E,
    - Rotavirus
    - Norovirus

- Transmission via Skin Lesions
  - HSV (herpes Simplex Virus) presenting as cold sores will be shed in the
    lesion and can be transmitted to not infected individuals

- Transmission vis Blood and Bodily Fluid
  - Blood
  - Semen
  - Breast Milk
  - Urine

### Routes of Transmission

- Horizontal Transmissions
  - Quite literally how its sounds spreads horizontally from person A to
    person B

- Vertical Transmision
  - Mother to child (One generation to the next)
    - Prenatal (transplacental)
    - Perinatal (infected birth canal)
    - Postnatal (milk or direct contact)

- Zoonoses
  - Transmission from animals (or requires an animal to transmit it)

## Symptoms

Symptoms are generally caused by:

- Damage to cells due to direct effect of virus infection:
  - cell detah by rupture during virus release
  - infected cell loses function
  - infected cell transformed by virus (tumours)
- Damage due to hose response to infection
  - Antibodies and immune cells destroy infected cells -> tissue damage
  - Symptoms of immune cells infiltrating the area where virus infection has
    occurred

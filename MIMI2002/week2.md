# Viruses

Viruses are not regarded as a true living organism purely because they are
incapable of making more viruses on their own without help from a host.

Viruses:

- Are **not** made of cells
- Can **not** reproduce on their own
- Do **not** undergo division
- Lack "machinery" for protein synthesis
  - No nucleus
  - No mitochondria
  - no ER
  - No golgi
  - No ribosomes

Viruses are extremely small to "see" a viral particle, an electron
microscope MUST be used.

## Structure fo a Virus

- Viruses have a nucleic acid genome or either DNA or RNA
- Viral genome encode the genetic information to make virus copies
  - Like a fork bomb script
- The nucleic acid is surrounded by a protective **protein coat** called
  a capsid
- In **some** viruses, there is an outer membranous layer called an
  **envelope**

> [!NOTE]
> Viruses with an envelope are called 'envelope viruses'
>
> Viruses without an envelope are called 'non-envelope viruses' or
> 'naked viruses'

## Viral Infections

### Portals of Entry

- Skin
- Respiratory Tract
- Gastrointestinal Tract
- Genitourinary Tract
- Conjunctiva

### Spread of Virus Within Host

- Localized Infection
  - Virus starts replicating at primary site of infection
    - Produces more viruses
    - Releases the produced viruses outside the cell (shedding to exterior)
  - Only spreads to adjacent cells
  - Examples:
    - Respiratory Infections
      - Influenza
      - Rhinovirus
    - Gastrointestinal Infections
      - Potaviruses
    - Skin Infections
      - Papilomaviruses

- Disseminated Infection
  - Must breach physical and immunological barriers
  - Extends beyond primary site of infection
  - Viruses move via circulatory system
    - Directly through capillaries vai bite or puncture
    - Can invade organs via blood vessels
    - Examples:
      - HIV
        - T Lymphocytes
        - Monocytes
      - EBV
        - B Lymphocytes
      - Measles
        - Monocytes
      - VZV
        - T Lymphocytes
  - Viruses can also move via the nervous system
    - Enters the sensory or motor nerve endings
    - Sensory
      - Dorsal Root Ganglia
    - Motor
      - Motor Neurons

- Systemic Infection
  - Affects many organs

> [!NOTE]
> When the virus moves out of the primary site they literally need to move
> to the preferred site of replication

### Immune Response

- Innate Immunity
  - First line of defence
    - Skin
    - Mucous Membranes
    - Gastric Acids
  - Second line of defence
    - Natural Killer Cells
    - Macrophages
    - Eosinophils
    - Cytokines
- Adaptive Immunity
  - Third line of defence
    - T-cells
      - Cell Killing
      - Cytokines
    - B-cells
      - Antibody Production

### Types of Infections

- Acute Infections
  - Rapid production of infectious virions
  - Rapid resolution and elimintation of infection
  - Examples:
    - Rhinovirus
    - Rotavirus
    - Influenza Virus
  - Usually brief in immunocompetent (normal) hosts
  - Virions and infected cells are completely cleared by immune response

- Persistent Infection
  - Not cleared effectively by the immune response
  - Virus particles or products continue to be produced for long periods
  - Two main types:
    - Slow/Chronic
      - Measles SSPE
      - HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)
    - Latent
  - Virus can periodically reawaken from latency
    - This process is called reactivation
  - Reactivation leads to new infection virus with/without disease
  - Herpes viruses are characterized by their capacity to establish a latent
    infection

## Virus Spreading

Transmission is dependent on:

- The number of virsu particles shed
- Number of virus particles required to infect a new host
- Stability of virus in the environemnt (how long can it live outside the host)

These are the methods in which a virus can spread:

- Transmission via Aerosols
  - Some of the most "popular" viruses spread via aerosols droplets (sneezing
    and coughing)
  - Example:
    - Influenza Virus
    - Corona Virus
    - Rhino Virus
    - Adeno Virus

- Faecal-Oral Transmission
  - There is usually alot of virus shed (virus particles) in watery diarrhoea
    and vomiting associated with viral gasroenteritis
  - Because of this it can spread via:
    - Shellfish harvested in contaminated areas
    - Any contact with contaminated surfaces
    - Contaminated food (even a drop)
  - Examples:
    - Hep A
    - Poliovirus
    - Hep E,
    - Rotavirus
    - Norovirus

- Transmission via Skin Lesions
  - HSV (herpes Simplex Virus) presenting as cold sores will be shed in the
    lesion and can be transmitted to not infected individuals

- Transmission vis Blood and Bodily Fluid
  - Blood
  - Semen
  - Breast Milk
  - Urine

### Routes of Transmission

- Horizontal Transmissions
  - Quite literally how its sounds spreads horizontally from person A to
    person B

- Vertical Transmision
  - Mother to child (One generation to the next)
    - Prenatal (transplacental)
    - Perinatal (infected birth canal)
    - Postnatal (milk or direct contact)

- Zoonoses
  - Transmission from animals (or requires an animal to transmit it)

## Symptoms

Symptoms are generally caused by:

- Damage to cells due to direct effect of virus infection:
  - cell detah by rupture during virus release
  - infected cell loses function
  - infected cell transformed by virus (tumours)
- Damage due to hose response to infection
  - Antibodies and immune cells destroy infected cells -> tissue damage
  - Symptoms of immune cells infiltrating the area where virus infection has
    occurred

# Immune System

The immune system is composed of 3 main things:

- Molecules
- Cells
- Specialized Tissues

And can ble split into 2 main parts:

- Innate immunity
- Adaptive immunity

## Innate Immunity

### Stages

1. Infection
   - Virus or Foreign Material enters the body
2. Recognition of pathogens by sensors
   - via cytokine release
   - Body notices pathogen and releases cytokines to alert the rest of the body
3. Activation of cells and inflammation
   - Complement activation
   - Recruitment of cells
   - Phagocytosis
4. Removal of infectious agent

White blood cells (leukocytes) must leave the bloodstream and go into the infected
tissue. The body does this in ordered steps using “smell signals” (chemokines) and
“Velcro” (adhesion molecules).

On a simplified step-by-step process:

1. Theres an infection in the tissue
2. The macrophage releases both cytokines and chemokines
   - The chemokines are basically letters/notes saying "hey this is the kind of virus
     /pathogen we are dealing with"
   - The cytokines tell the endothelial cell to "raise the red flag (selectins), the
     problem is in this area"
3. The leukocytes who are just minding their own business, traveling through the blood
   stream, notice the selectins and go "oh shit theres a problem in this area" and
   follow the notes left behind (the chemokines)
   - The instant they know theres a problem in the area they slow down by activating
     the **selectins** on their cell surface
   - Think of selectins like a surface that is normally smooth for faster travel,
     then turning rough so they can get a grip on a surface.
   - This "slow down" process is called **rolling**
   - While rolling, chemokines bind to leukocyte chemokine receptors → this flips
     integrins into their “rough gripping” state.
4. Once on the surface, the leukocyte, crawls (rolls) along the endothelial surface,
   and eventually the **integrins** bind with their respective ligands and comes to a
   full stop. The leukocyte squeezes between endothelial cells. Where it sees the
   infection and kills the problem.

## Adaptive Immunity

- Takes days to mount a response
  - Requires activation
- Highly specific recognition
  - Recognises distinct parts of a molecule (antigens, epitopes)
- HUGE diversity
- Clonal expansion
- Memory
- Does not react to self — needs education

Naïve T & B cells don’t fight yet; they must be activated by antigen in secondary
lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, spleen, mucosal/cutaneous lymphoid tissues).
Analogy: Rookie officers wait at the station until a case briefing sends them out.

### Analogy Summary

The lymphatic system acts as the body's sewage system. As the body tissues keep
working with fluids, there's bound to be overflow and if not handeled, the overflowing
liquid could cause massive swelling hence, the body uses the lymphatic system to handle
this problem.

So when theres a virus or pathogen or something. The tissue leaks lets say "radioactive
waste".

Now theres the emergency aid system that's basically a dentritic cell acting as a
sponge to contain the problem, but obviously its not enough, so the dendritic cell
"safely" moves this waste (safely carries a sample of this waste) into the lymphatic
(sewage) system and goes "Hey I got XX kind of radioactive waste here, we need to take
care of this problem"

- More specifically the dentritic cell consumes the pathogen and moves into the nearest
  lymph node while presenting an antigen (something the body can use to identify this
  spefic pathogen)

Since the threat is known, the Naïve T & B cells get activated (they get a target to
kill, think of them as hitman that are on standby until we give them a photo), and
are sent out to kill those specific targets.

### Where cells grow vs. where they get activated

- Primary lymphoid organs (grow/educate):
  - Bone marrow: B cells mature
  - Thymus: T cells mature
  - Analogy: Medical school (bone marrow) and police academy (thymus).

- Secondary lymphoid organs (where they get activated):
  - Lymph nodes: tissue/skin infections drain here
  - Spleen: filters blood-borne antigens
  - MALT/CALT: mucosal & skin checkpoints (e.g., tonsils, Peyer’s patches)
  - Analogy: City precincts where rookies meet messengers and get assignments.

### The Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system = green side-roads + storm drains

**Job**: Specialized vessels that drain fluid from tissues and carry it to lymph nodes.
**Analogy**: Street storm drains feeding a neighborhood police station.

**Why it matters**: Keeps tissue fluid balanced and funnels evidence (microbes/antigens)
and messengers (dendritic cells) to the node where immune responses start.

Antigen gets from tissue to a lymph node

- Dendritic cells (DCs) carry it
  - DCs eat microbes, load peptides onto MHC, then migrate in lymph to the node.
  - Analogy: A field detective collects evidence and drives it to the station with the
    lights on.

- Free antigen can drain too
  - Bits of microbe flow in tissue fluid to the node and are picked up there by
    macrophages/DCs.
  - Analogy: Loose evidence washes down the storm drain and is logged at intake.

Lymph node layout = organized building

- Afferent lymphatic vessels (INBOUND): bring lymph + DCs into the node.
  - Analogy: Side doors where deliveries arrive.
- Subcapsular sinus: first hallway under the “roof” (capsule) where incoming lymph
  spreads.
  - Analogy: Mailroom where packages get sorted.
- B-cell zone (follicles; can form germinal centers):
  - Analogy: Open-plan office for B teams doing upgrades (class switch, affinity
    maturation).
- T-cell zone (paracortex):
  - Analogy: Briefing room where DCs present wanted posters (peptide–MHC) to naïve
    T cells.
- High Endothelial Venules (HEV): entry from blood for naïve lymphocytes.
  - Analogy: A special staff entrance from the main highway.
- Efferent lymphatic vessel (OUTBOUND): exits toward the next node or bloodstream.
  - Analogy: Back driveway where activated squads roll out.

### Who goes where (traffic rules)

Migrating DCs + tissue fluid enter via afferent lymphatics → subcapsular sinus →
T zone (to present antigen).
Analogy: Couriers come through the side door to the briefing room.

Naïve T & B cells arrive from blood via HEV and home to their zones (T zone/B follicles).
Analogy: Rookies badge in through the staff entrance and head to their departments.

After activation, cells leave via the efferent vessel to fight at the infection site.
Analogy: Units deploy out the back driveway to the field.

### Which station handles which kind of case?

Lymph nodes: tissue/skin infections (stuff that drains via lymph).
Analogy: Neighborhood precincts.

Spleen: blood-borne infections (everything in circulation).
Analogy: Central customs checkpoint.

MALT/CALT (tonsils, Peyer’s patches, etc.): mucosal & skin entry points.
Analogy: Airport security at busy gates.

### Naïve lymphocytes (recirculation loop)

What: Newly matured but untested T and B cells (“naïve”) cycle continuously through
blood → secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen, MALT) → lymph → blood until
they meet their antigen.

Why: Maximizes the chance each rare cell meets the one antigen it fits.

Key movers:

- CD62L/L-selectin (on naïve cells) → lets them enter nodes via HEV.
- CCR7 (on naïve cells) senses CCL19/CCL21 in T-cell zones → proper positioning.
- S1P₁ receptor senses sphingosine-1-phosphate gradient → exit via efferent lymph.

Analogy: Like trainees riding a metro loop: special turnstiles (HEV) let them into
stations (nodes); platform signs (CCL19/21) guide them to the right room; the outbound
train (S1P gradient) takes them to the next station to keep searching.

### Naïve T-cell trafficking

These guys are basically hitmen that have not recieved a photo of who to kill. They
will keep travelling through blood (airplanes) and lymph nodes (airports) until they
recieve a target (at the airport) then go out on a hunt to kill.

Entry (HEV in lymph node):

- Endothelium shows: L-selectin ligand, ICAM-1, CCL19/CCL21.
- Naïve T cell shows: L-selectin (CD62L), LFA-1 (β2-integrin), CCR7.
- Sequence: L-selectin → rolling; CCL19/21 → activate LFA-1; LFA-1 ↔ ICAM-1 →
  firm arrest → diapedesis into T-zone.

Exit: S1P₁ pulls cells toward efferent lymphatics when they haven’t been activated.

After activation (different story): Effector T cells switch homing gear (e.g.,
E/P-selectin ligands, CXCR3, VLA-4) to target inflamed tissues (binding VCAM-1/ICAM-1).
Naïve cells don’t do this yet.

Analogy: Think airport gates: L-selectin is your boarding pass check, CCL19/21 is the
“Proceed to Gate” alert, LFA-1/ICAM-1 is the jet bridge lock-in. S1P is the moving
walkway to the next terminal if your flight (antigen) isn’t there.

### Lymphatic capillaries (how fluid & antigen enter lymph)

Structure: Blind-ended capillaries with flap-like mini-valves; anchoring filaments
pull valves open when tissue swells. One-way valves prevent backflow.

Function: Sweep up excess fluid, free antigen, and migrating dendritic cells → deliver
to lymph nodes.

Analogy: Shop vac with spring-loaded doors—pressure outside opens them to suck in
spill; doors snap shut to keep it in while the hose carries it to the filter (node).

### Antigen vs. epitope vs. peptides

Antigen: Anything a BCR or TCR can bind (proteins, lipids, polysaccharides…).

Epitope: The specific piece of the antigen that the receptor recognizes.

Peptides: Short protein fragments presented by MHC to T cells.

Analogy: Antigen = book; epitope = a sentence in that book; peptide on MHC = that
sentence photocopied and pinned to a notice board for T cells.

### B-cell receptor (BCR) vs T-cell receptor (TCR)

B cells

- Recognize native, whole antigens (no MHC needed).
- Often get help from Tfh cells for class switching/affinity maturation.
- Analogy: B cells can look at the whole object in the evidence bag.

T cells

- Recognize peptide–MHC complexes on host cells/APCs (CD4 ↔ MHC II; CD8 ↔ MHC I).
- CD8⁺ kill infected cells; CD4⁺ coordinate/help others.
- Analogy: T cells only act when the front desk puts a photo (peptide) on an official
  badge (MHC)—no badge, no case.

### MHC-I & CD8 T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTLs)

What they see: CD8 T cells recognize peptides on MHC-I.
Analogy: Patrol officers checking a \*“factory’s internal selfie badge.”

Peptide source: Inside the cell (viral proteins, tumor/abnormal self).

Where MHC-I is found: All nucleated cells (not RBCs).

After activation: CD8 T cells become CTLs that kill infected cells (perforin/granzymes,
Fas–FasL) and limit pathogen spread.
Analogy: If the selfie shows sabotage, SWAT shuts the factory down.

Why this matters: Because every nucleated cell shows internal status, CTLs can target any virus-infected cell type.

### MHC-II & CD4 T cells (helper T cells)

What they see: CD4 T cells recognize peptides on MHC-II.
Analogy: Detectives reviewing an evidence board curated by professionals.

Peptide source: Outside the cell → phagocytosed, processed, displayed.

Where MHC-II is found: Professional APCs only — dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells.

After activation: CD4 T cells coordinate others:

Th1 → help macrophages kill intracellular microbes

Tfh → help B cells class-switch & affinity-mature

Th2/Th17 → help against parasites/extracellular bacteria
Analogy: Team leaders assign tasks and supply the right tools (cytokines).

### APCs activate naïve T cells (the 3-signal rule)

Signal 1: TCR ↔ peptide–MHC (specificity).
Analogy: Face match on the wanted poster.

Signal 2 (costim): CD28 ↔ B7 (CD80/86).
Analogy: Official stamp to open the case; without it → anergy.

Signal 3 (cytokines): IL-12/IL-4/TGF-β/IL-6… shape Th/CTL fate.
Analogy: Mission brief telling squads what role to take.

Result: Clonal expansion + effector function; TCR specificity unchanged (same target,
more soldiers).

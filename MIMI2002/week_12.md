# Structure of the Skin and Immune Response

Layers of the skin:

- Stratum corneum – outermost layer of dead keratinized cells; acts as a physical barrier.
- Epidermis – protective outer covering; hosts immune cells like Langerhans cells.
- Dermis – contains connective tissue, blood vessels, and immune cells.
- Subcutis (hypodermis) – fat layer providing cushioning and insulation.
- Fascia – connective tissue beneath the subcutis.

Appendages:

- Hair follicles
- Sweat glands
- Sebaceous (oil) glands

> [!note]
> Immune response site: primarily at the epidermis and dermis, where immune cells detect pathogens
> entering through breaks in the skin.

# Host Factors Preventing and Promoting Skin Infection

## Preventive Factors (Barriers to Infection)

Physical Barriers:

- Intact stratum corneum and epidermis prevent pathogen entry.
- Continuous shedding of surface cells removes microbes.

Chemical Barriers:

- Low pH from sebum and fatty acids discourages bacterial growth.
- High salt concentration from sweat inhibits many microbes.

Biological Barriers:

- Resident microbiota (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Cutibacterium acnes) compete for nutrients
  and space, and stimulate immune defenses.

Immune System:

- Immune surveillance by dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells (covered in later lectures).

Promoting Factors (When Protection Fails)

- Breaks in the skin (cuts, trauma, burns)
- Inflammation and excess moisture (maceration)
- Blocked pores or follicles (fosters bacterial growth)
- Underlying conditions like diabetes or immune suppression.

# Common Bacterial Pathogens and Associated Diseases

1. Staphylococcus aureus
   - Colonization: in nose (20–40% of people) → spreads to skin.
   - Diseases:
     - Impetigo (with Strep. pyogenes): superficial blisters, no scarring.
     - Folliculitis: infected hair follicles.
     - Furuncles (boils): deeper infection extending from folliculitis.
     - Carbuncles: coalesced boils → possible systemic spread (fever).
     - Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS): exfoliatin toxin causes epidermal peeling,
       mostly in children.

2. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep)
   - Diseases:
     - Impetigo (alone or with S. aureus).
     - Erysipelas: dermal infection; bright red lesions due to immune response.
     - Cellulitis: deeper dermal/subcutaneous infection; fever and chills.
     - Necrotizing fasciitis: “flesh-eating disease” caused by toxins (SpeA, SpeC, SpeB).

3. Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes)
   - Disease: Acne vulgaris – overproduction of sebum promotes bacterial growth → inflammation and
     comedones (pimples/blackheads).

4. Clostridium perfringens
   - Disease: Gas gangrene – produces alpha toxin that destroys tissue; may require
     surgery/amputation; antibiotics often ineffective.

# Staphylococcus aureus – Virulence, Transmission, and Treatment

Virulence Factors

- Cell capsule: inhibits phagocytosis; helps form biofilms.
- Toxins:
  - TSST-1 (toxic shock syndrome toxin)
  - Exfoliatin (causes SSSS)
  - Hemolysins and leukocidins (destroy host cells)
- Invasins: enzymes that degrade host tissue to promote spread.
- Superantigens: overactivate T-cells → massive cytokine release and inflammation.
- Protein A: binds antibodies, preventing immune clearance.
- Adhesins: allow attachment to skin proteins like fibronectin and fibrinogen.

Transmission

- Reservoir: anterior nares (nose) — ~20% persistent carriers.
- Spread: direct contact, endogenous infection (from person’s own flora).

Treatment and Control

- No available vaccine.
- Mild infections: topical/oral antibiotics.
- Severe infections: IV broad-spectrum antibiotics; treatment failures common.
- Antibiotic resistance:
  - MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) – often multi-drug resistant.

# Dermatophyte Virulence, Transmission, Immune Response, and Treatment

## Dermatophyte Overview

Causative agents: Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton

Common diseases: Tinea infections (ringworm, athlete’s foot, jock itch, nail
infections)

Infection site: Stratum corneum (keratinised layer) — fungi digest keratin for
nutrients

## Virulence Factors

Proteases: Degrade host keratin and other proteins → tissue invasion.

LysM proteins: Bind fungal cell wall chitin → promote adhesion & immune evasion.

Secondary metabolites: May act as immunosuppressive or antimicrobial toxins.

Signalling adaptability: Rapid adjustment to pH, humidity, and antifungal stress.

Abundant spores: Enable persistence and transmission.

## Transmission

Spread: Direct contact or via contaminated items (towels, bedding, clothing).

Reservoirs: Humans, animals, and soil (anthropophilic, zoophilic, geophilic species).

Risk factors: Warm/moist environments, friction, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression.

## Immune Response

Inflammation creates the characteristic ring shape (“ringworm”) — immune attack limits
fungal growth at edges.

Immunocompromised individuals experience more severe and chronic infections.

## Treatment and Control

Topical antifungals: Azoles (inhibit ergosterol synthesis → disrupt membrane).

Environmental management: Keep skin dry, lower pH, avoid sharing personal items.

Systemic antifungals: Required for nail infections.

Selenium sulfide: Promotes shedding of infected keratin layers.

Prevention: Hygiene, drying footwear, avoiding contact with infected surfaces.

# Infectious vs. Non-Infectious Viral Skin Manifestations

## Infectious Viral Skin Infections (True skin infections)

Viruses replicate within skin cells — lesions are infectious:

- HPV: Causes warts.
- Herpes simplex virus (HSV): Cold sores, genital herpes.
- Varicella-zoster virus (VZV): Chickenpox and shingles.
- Smallpox, mpox, enteroviruses: Systemic viral infections that replicate in skin
  tissues.

## Non-Infectious Viral Rashes (Immune-mediated)

Skin reaction results from immune response to systemic viral infection — not
contagious:

- Measles: Immune response causes rash.
- Rubella (German measles) and Roseola (HHV-6/7): Rash follows fever due to immune
  activation.
- Parvovirus B19: “Slapped cheek” rash (fifth disease).

| Feature                    | Infectious Lesions | Non-Infectious Rashes   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Viral replication in skin? | Yes                | No                      |
| Contagious?                | Yes                | No                      |
| Example                    | Herpes, HPV, VZV   | Measles, Parvovirus B19 |

# Human Papillomavirus (HPV): Transmission and Disease

## Structure and Genome

Non-enveloped circular dsDNA virus (~8 kb).

Genes: 6 early (E1–E7) for replication and oncogenesis, 2 late (L1, L2) for capsid.

- There are > 150 genotypes:
  - HPV 6 & 11 → warts (benign).
  - HPV 16 & 18 → cervical/oral cancers.

## Transmission

Direct contact: Through minor abrasions.

Sexual transmission: Leads to genital HPV.

Asymptomatic shedding: Possible even without visible lesions.

## Pathogenesis & Disease

Infects basal epithelial cells through microabrasions.

Causes hyperproliferative lesions (warts) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

Symptoms appear after 3–4 months of incubation.

Many infections are self-limiting (resolve in 1–2 years).

## HPV Infection Cycle

Virus enters basal layer, persists as episomal DNA.

Viral gene expression follows cell differentiation up to surface.

Immune evasion:

- PRRs downregulated.
- Interferon (IFN-I) response suppressed.
- MHC I & II downregulated → poor immune detection.

Replicates in nucleus using host DNA polymerase (page 30).

## Treatment & Prevention

Vaccination (Gardasil, Cervarix): Targets HPV 16, 18, and others; prevents warts &
cervical cancer.

Barrier methods: Condoms reduce transmission.

Screening: Pap smears detect early cervical abnormalities.

Therapies:

- Imiquimod: TLR-7 agonist → stimulates innate immune response.
- Surgical removal of lesions for persistent cases.

# The Skin Infection Disease Cycle (Generalised Framework)

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transmission**         | Spread via contact, droplets, fomites, vectors             | Skin barrier, innate defenses                    | Spores (fungi), stable virions (HPV), envelope resistance           |
| **Initial Infection**    | Entry via microabrasions or follicles                      | Innate immune response (inflammation, cytokines) | Adhesion molecules, immune evasion (e.g., LysM, PRR downregulation) |
| **Chronic/Latent Phase** | Pathogen persists (e.g., VZV latency, fungal colonisation) | Adaptive immunity limits replication             | Latency genes (VZV), keratin colonisation (dermatophytes)           |
| **Recurrence**           | Reactivation (stress, immune suppression)                  | Immune decline triggers reactivation             | Viral latency reactivation, fungal spore germination                |

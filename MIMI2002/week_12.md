# Structure of the Skin and Immune Response

Layers of the skin:

- Stratum corneum – outermost layer of dead keratinized cells; acts as a physical barrier.
- Epidermis – protective outer covering; hosts immune cells like Langerhans cells.
- Dermis – contains connective tissue, blood vessels, and immune cells.
- Subcutis (hypodermis) – fat layer providing cushioning and insulation.
- Fascia – connective tissue beneath the subcutis.

Appendages:

- Hair follicles
- Sweat glands
- Sebaceous (oil) glands

> [!note]
> Immune response site: primarily at the epidermis and dermis, where immune cells detect pathogens
> entering through breaks in the skin.

# Host Factors Preventing and Promoting Skin Infection

## Preventive Factors (Barriers to Infection)

Physical Barriers:

- Intact stratum corneum and epidermis prevent pathogen entry.
- Continuous shedding of surface cells removes microbes.

Chemical Barriers:

- Low pH from sebum and fatty acids discourages bacterial growth.
- High salt concentration from sweat inhibits many microbes.

Biological Barriers:

- Resident microbiota (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Cutibacterium acnes) compete for nutrients
  and space, and stimulate immune defenses.

Immune System:

- Immune surveillance by dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells (covered in later lectures).

Promoting Factors (When Protection Fails)

- Breaks in the skin (cuts, trauma, burns)
- Inflammation and excess moisture (maceration)
- Blocked pores or follicles (fosters bacterial growth)
- Underlying conditions like diabetes or immune suppression.

# Common Bacterial Pathogens and Associated Diseases

1. Staphylococcus aureus
   - Colonization: in nose (20–40% of people) → spreads to skin.
   - Diseases:
     - Impetigo (with Strep. pyogenes): superficial blisters, no scarring.
     - Folliculitis: infected hair follicles.
     - Furuncles (boils): deeper infection extending from folliculitis.
     - Carbuncles: coalesced boils → possible systemic spread (fever).
     - Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS): exfoliatin toxin causes epidermal peeling,
       mostly in children.

2. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep)
   - Diseases:
     - Impetigo (alone or with S. aureus).
     - Erysipelas: dermal infection; bright red lesions due to immune response.
     - Cellulitis: deeper dermal/subcutaneous infection; fever and chills.
     - Necrotizing fasciitis: “flesh-eating disease” caused by toxins (SpeA, SpeC, SpeB).

3. Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes)
   - Disease: Acne vulgaris – overproduction of sebum promotes bacterial growth → inflammation and
     comedones (pimples/blackheads).

4. Clostridium perfringens
   - Disease: Gas gangrene – produces alpha toxin that destroys tissue; may require
     surgery/amputation; antibiotics often ineffective.

# Staphylococcus aureus – Virulence, Transmission, and Treatment

Virulence Factors

- Cell capsule: inhibits phagocytosis; helps form biofilms.
- Toxins:
  - TSST-1 (toxic shock syndrome toxin)
  - Exfoliatin (causes SSSS)
  - Hemolysins and leukocidins (destroy host cells)
- Invasins: enzymes that degrade host tissue to promote spread.
- Superantigens: overactivate T-cells → massive cytokine release and inflammation.
- Protein A: binds antibodies, preventing immune clearance.
- Adhesins: allow attachment to skin proteins like fibronectin and fibrinogen.

Transmission

- Reservoir: anterior nares (nose) — ~20% persistent carriers.
- Spread: direct contact, endogenous infection (from person’s own flora).

Treatment and Control

- No available vaccine.
- Mild infections: topical/oral antibiotics.
- Severe infections: IV broad-spectrum antibiotics; treatment failures common.
- Antibiotic resistance:
  - MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) – often multi-drug resistant.

# Role of phagocytes including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells

- Neutrophils
  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs); most abundant leukocyte in blood.
  - Normally not present in tissues until recruited.
  - Functions:
    - Rapidly recruited to infection sites within minutes.
    - First responders, dominate during acute infection.
    - Phagocytose microbes in blood/tissue.
    - Release antimicrobial enzymes and can undergo Netosis (release DNA traps to capture microbes).
  - Short-lived: survive only hours in tissue.
  - Derived from common myeloid progenitor in bone marrow; production increases during infection.

- Monocytes
  - Circulate in the blood, where they can phagocytose microbes.
  - Upon entering tissues, they differentiate into macrophages.
  - Derived from common myeloid progenitor in bone marrow.
  - Can be long-lived (unlike neutrophils).
  - Play a role in both steady-state patrolling and responding to acute inflammation.

- Macrophages
  - Found in tissues, either:
    - Derived from monocytes, or
    - Tissue-resident progenitors (e.g., alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells, microglia).
  - Functions:
    - Phagocytosis of microbes and debris.
    - Cytokine production (TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12) → inflammation and immune cell recruitment.
    - Antigen presentation to T-cells (bridge between innate and adaptive immunity).
    - Produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide to kill microbes.

- Dendritic Cells (DCs)
  - Found in peripheral tissues (e.g., skin, mucosa) where they capture pathogens/antigens.
  - Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
  - Functions:
    - Sense and capture antigens.
    - Migrate to lymph nodes to initiate adaptive immunity by activating T-cells.
    - Bridge innate and adaptive immune responses.
  - Types:
    - Classical/conventional DCs
    - Plasmacytoid DCs
    - Langerhans cells (skin DCs)

# Immune environment in the normal lung/respiratory tract

- Structural and Barrier Defenses
  - Upper respiratory tract (nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx) and lower respiratory tract (trachea,
    bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli) are lined with specialized epithelial cells.
  - Ciliated epithelial cells: move mucus and trapped particles upward (mucociliary clearance).
  - Goblet cells: secrete mucus that traps pathogens and particulates.
  - Basal cells: progenitor cells that maintain epithelial integrity.
  - Club (Clara) cells: detoxifying and secretory functions.

- Innate Immune Cells
  - Alveolar macrophages:
    - Live in alveolar spaces.
    - Tissue-resident, long-lived.
    - Maintain lung homeostasis by clearing debris and apoptotic cells.
    - Act as first responders to infection, phagocytosing microbes.
  - Interstitial macrophages:
    - Located in lung tissue (interstitium).
    - Contribute to immune regulation and tolerance.
  - Dendritic cells (DCs):
    - Sample antigens in airways and alveoli.
    - Migrate to lymph nodes to initiate adaptive immune responses.

- Adaptive Immune Surveillance
  - T-cells (especially CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells) are present in lung tissue.
  - Provide immune surveillance and memory responses.

- Homeostasis vs. Defense
  - Normal state: immune system maintains tolerance to harmless inhaled particles and commensals.
  - Upon infection: rapid activation of alveolar macrophages and recruitment of neutrophils and
    monocytes.
  - Balance: Lung immunity must control pathogens while avoiding excessive inflammation (which can
    damage delicate alveolar structures needed for gas exchange).

# Maturation process of dendritic cells

1. Immature Dendritic Cells (in peripheral tissues)
   - Found in tissues such as skin (e.g., Langerhans cells).
   - Highly efficient at phagocytosis (engulfing microbes, debris, and antigens).
   - Capture pathogens or can become infected by viruses.
   - Express receptors like Fc receptors and mannose receptors for antigen uptake.
   - Primary function: antigen capture and processing, not T-cell activation.

2. Activation Trigger
   - Recognition of pathogens through PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) such as Toll-like receptors
     (TLRs).
   - Leads to activation and start of maturation program.

3. Changes During Maturation
   - Decrease in phagocytosis (focus shifts from antigen capture to antigen presentation).
   - Increase in MHC-I and MHC-II expression → enables presentation of antigens to both CD8+ and CD4+
     T cells.
   - Increase in co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., B7-1/CD80, B7-2/CD86, ICAM-1, IL-12) → essential for
     T-cell activation.
   - Expression of CCR7 → chemokine receptor that directs migration towards lymph nodes.

4. Migration to Lymph Node
   - Mature DCs travel via lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes.
   - Relocate from peripheral tissues to the T-cell zones of lymph nodes.

5. Mature/Activated Dendritic Cells
   - Specialised for antigen presentation rather than capture.
   - Present processed antigens on MHC-I and MHC-II to naïve T cells.
   - Strong expression of co-stimulatory molecules ensures effective activation of T cells and
     initiation of adaptive immune response.
   - Increased half-life and number of surface MHC-II molecules (from ~10 hr to >100 hr, ~10⁶ to
     \~7×10⁶ molecules).

# Steps in the MHC-I and MHC-II antigen processing pathways

- MHC-I Antigen Processing Pathway (Endogenous Pathway)
  - Where? Occurs in all nucleated cells.
  - Purpose? Present intracellular antigens (self, viral, tumor proteins) to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.
  - Steps:
    1. Protein Production in Cytosol
       - Proteins can be self, viral, or tumor-derived.
       - Some microbial proteins can leak from phagosomes into the cytosol.
    2. Protein Degradation
       - Proteins are tagged with ubiquitin.
       - Degraded into peptides by the proteasome.
    3. Transport into ER
       - Peptides transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via TAP (Transporter associated
         with Antigen Processing).
       - Tapasin helps link MHC-I to TAP for efficient loading.
    4. MHC-I Synthesis in ER
       - MHC-I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin are assembled in the ER.
       - Must bind a stable peptide before leaving ER.
    5. Peptide Loading
       - Incoming peptides bind into the groove of MHC-I.
       - Chaperones (e.g., calnexin, calreticulin) assist folding.
    6. Transport to Cell Surface
       - Peptide-MHC-I complexes are carried via the Golgi → exocytic vesicles → cell surface.
       - Recognized by CD8+ T cells.

- MHC-II Antigen Processing Pathway (Exogenous Pathway)
  - Where? Occurs in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs): dendritic cells, macrophages, B
    cells.
  - Purpose? Present extracellular antigens to CD4+ helper T cells.
  - Steps:
    1. Antigen Uptake
       - Extracellular antigens are phagocytosed or endocytosed into vesicles.
    2. Antigen Processing
       - Endocytic vesicles fuse with lysosomes.
       - Proteins degraded into peptides.
    3. MHC-II Synthesis in ER
       - MHC-II molecules are made in the ER.
       - Invariant chain (Ii) binds to MHC-II to block premature peptide binding.
       - Ii contains a fragment called CLIP that occupies the binding groove.
    4. Transport of MHC-II
       - MHC-II + CLIP complex traffics via Golgi to acidic endosomes/lysosomes.
    5. Exchange of CLIP for Antigen Peptide
       - In lysosomal compartments, Ii is degraded, leaving CLIP in the binding groove.
       - HLA-DM catalyzes exchange: removes CLIP, replaces it with processed peptides.
    6. Transport to Cell Surface
       - Stable peptide-MHC-II complexes are transported to the cell surface.
       - Recognized by CD4+ T helper cells.

# MHC restriction

- Definition
  - MHC restriction is the principle that T cells can only recognize antigen when it is presented on
    self-MHC molecules.
  - In other words, a T cell receptor (TCR) does not simply recognize the antigenic peptide by itself
    – it must recognize the peptide–MHC complex.

- Types
  - CD8+ T cells (Cytotoxic T cells)
    - Restricted to recognizing antigens presented on MHC-I molecules.
    - CD8 coreceptor binds to MHC-I, ensuring specificity.
  - CD4+ T cells (Helper T cells)
    - Restricted to recognizing antigens presented on MHC-II molecules.
    - CD4 coreceptor binds to MHC-II, ensuring specificity.

- Mechanism
  - During T cell development in the thymus, immature T cells undergo:
    - Positive selection: T cells that can recognize self-MHC (with self-peptides) survive.
    - Negative selection: T cells that bind too strongly to self-MHC + self-peptide are eliminated
      (to prevent autoimmunity).
  - This process "educates" T cells to recognize antigen only when presented by self-MHC molecules.

- Functional Importance
  - Ensures that T cells respond only to antigens displayed by host cells (not free-floating peptides).
  - Provides specificity:
    - CD8+ T cells → kill infected cells displaying antigen via MHC-I.
    - CD4+ T cells → help other immune cells when antigen is displayed via MHC-II.
  - Prevents inappropriate activation by free peptides or foreign MHC molecules.

# How naïve T cells are activated and the importance of costimulation

Naïve T cells (those that have left the thymus but not yet encountered antigen) require two signals
from antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to become activated:

- Signal 1: Antigen Recognition
  - T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognizes a specific antigen peptide presented on MHC molecules of an APC.
    - CD8+ T cells → recognize peptides on MHC-I.
    - CD4+ T cells → recognize peptides on MHC-II.
  - This provides specificity (which antigen to respond to).

- Signal 2: Co-stimulation
  - Provided by interaction between co-stimulatory molecules on APCs and receptors on T cells.
  - Key interaction:
    - APC expresses B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) after PRR activation by microbes.
    - B7 binds to CD28 on T cells.
  - This ensures that T cells only respond when pathogens trigger innate immunity (avoiding
    inappropriate activation).

- Additional Signals: Cytokines (Signal 3)
  - APCs also release cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-12, IFNs) which guide T cell differentiation into
    effector subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, or cytotoxic CD8+).

## Importance of Co-stimulation

- Without co-stimulation:
  - TCR recognition alone → T cells become anergic (non-responsive) or may undergo apoptosis.
  - This prevents immune responses against harmless antigens or self-peptides.

- With co-stimulation:
  - T cells undergo proliferation (clonal expansion) and differentiation into effector T cells.
  - Effector CD8+ T cells kill infected cells.
  - Effector CD4+ T cells provide help to B cells and macrophages.

- Role of APCs
  - Only professional APCs (dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells) can activate naïve T cells
    because they provide both MHC–peptide complexes and co-stimulatory molecules.
  - Dendritic cells are the most potent APCs:
  - Migrate to lymph nodes after pathogen encounter.
  - Can interact with thousands of T cells per hour to find the right antigen-specific TCR.

# How T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity is generated

# Burnet’s clonal selection hypothesis (conceptual steps)

1. Pre-existing specificity: Each lymphocyte (B or T) bears receptors of a single
   specificity generated before antigen exposure.
2. Antigen selects the clone: When an antigen binds its matching receptor with
   sufficient affinity, it selects that lymphocyte.
3. Clonal expansion: The selected cell proliferates, generating a clone of identical,
   antigen-specific effector cells.
4. Differentiation: Progeny become effector cells (e.g., cytotoxic T cells or helper
   T cells) to clear the antigen, and memory cells for faster responses next time.
5. Self-tolerance: Clones with high affinity for self are eliminated or inactivated
   during development (central/peripheral tolerance), explaining why the immune system
   usually ignores self.

# Steps in T-cell maturation (thymus “boot camp”)

1. From bone marrow → thymus: immature pro-T cells arrive.
   - Analogy: recruits entering boot camp.
2. β chain first: TCR-β recombines → pre-TCR forms with invariant pre-Tα (checkpoint).
   - Analogy: test-firing the rifle frame before adding the scope.
3. α chain next: TCR-α recombines → full αβ TCR on a double-positive (DP) CD4⁺CD8⁺
   thymocyte.
4. Positive selection: keep cells that weakly recognize self-MHC + self peptide; they
   become single-positive and keep the matching co-receptor:
   - Recognize MHC-I → CD8⁺; MHC-II → CD4⁺.
   - Analogy: door scanner: your badge must register, but not cling.
5. Negative selection: delete cells that bind too strongly to self-MHC + peptide
   (central tolerance).
   - Analogy: eject anyone who hugs the scanner—too risky.
6. Exit as naïve CD4⁺ or CD8⁺ T cells → circulate through blood ↔ lymph nodes looking
   for antigen on APCs.

# Clonal expansion & memory cells — why responses get faster

1. Activation needs two signals: TCR + co-stimulation (e.g., CD28) → IL-2 production
   drives proliferation.
   - Analogy: key + ignition = engine revs.
2. Clonal expansion: antigen-specific T cells can increase ~10,000-fold during
   infection; non-specific cells don’t expand. (p24)
   - Analogy: only the matching “unit” gets mass-called up.
3. Contraction: after pathogen control, 90–95% die, returning toward baseline.
4. Memory T cells: long-lived, maintained by cytokines (not continuous antigen), react
   faster and need less co-stimulation on re-exposure; can be CD4 or CD8.
   - Analogy: veterans on reserve—trained, equipped, mobilize quickly.

# CD8 vs CD4 T cells — what they see & what they do

- CD8 (Cytotoxic T cells, CTLs)
  - Recognize peptides from intracellular sources on MHC-I (on all nucleated cells).
  - Kill infected cells directly.
  - Analogy: SWAT team eliminating compromised rooms.

- CD4 (Helper T cells)
  - Recognize peptides from extracellular sources on MHC-II (on DCs, macrophages, B
    cells).
  - Coordinate immunity via cytokines (activate macrophages, help B cells,
    orchestrate inflammation).
  - Analogy: field commanders giving orders and upgrades.

# CD4 T-cell subsets — signatures & jobs

- Th1 — IFN-γ; activates macrophages; best for intracellular microbes (e.g., Mtb).
  - Analogy: turns macrophages into “super-janitors” with stronger bleach.
- Th2 — IL-4, IL-5, IL-13; fights helminths; promotes eosinophils & mucus; linked to
  allergy.
  - Analogy: pest-control team specializing in big worms.
- Th17 — IL-17; recruits neutrophils; good for extracellular bacteria & fungi;
  implicated in autoimmunity.
  - Analogy: calls in street-sweepers (neutrophils) for dirty, slippery roads.
- Regulatory T cells (Tregs) — CD4⁺ suppressors that maintain tolerance; mechanisms
  include IL-10, reducing APC stimulation, and soaking up IL-2.
  - Analogy: referees blowing the whistle to stop friendly fire.

# Other T-cell flavors vs αβ T cells

- γδ T cells: often tissue-resident; non-classical antigen recognition (sometimes
  MHC-independent); fast “innate-like” responses.
  - Analogy: border rangers—fewer rules, quicker reactions.

- NKT cells: semi-invariant TCRs recognizing lipid antigens on CD1d; rapid cytokine
  bursts (IFN-γ/IL-4).
  - Analogy: special liaison unit between innate and adaptive.

- MAIT cells: recognize vitamin B metabolite antigens on MR1; enriched in mucosa &
  liver; quick antimicrobial responses.
  - Analogy: metro patrols guarding transit hubs (mucosa).

> [!NOTE]
> (These three “bridge” innate and adaptive immunity; αβ T cells use peptide–MHC with
> vast receptor diversity.)

# How T cells + innate cells team up vs intracellular bacteria (e.g., TB)

- Sensing & priming in LN: DCs ingest bacteria, migrate to LN, present MHC-II peptides
  to naïve CD4 → Th1 differentiation (driven by IL-12 from APCs and IFN-γ from NK).
  - Analogy: crime scene data sent to HQ to brief the right squad.

- Macrophage activation on site: Th1 cells reach the lesion and deliver a dual
  hit—IFN-γ + CD40L–CD40—that boosts ROS/NO/lysosomal enzymes to kill microbes inside
  phagosomes.
  - Analogy: upgrade the cleaning crew with stronger detergents and better tools.

- If bacteria escape the vesicle: CD8 CTLs recognize infected cells via MHC-I and kill
  the host cell, eliminating the bacterial factory.
  - Analogy: demolish the compromised room to stop further spread.

- Early innate help: NK cells/ILC1 provide IFN-γ early to bias Th1 responses.

- When control fails: persistent infection → granulomas, chronic macrophage/T-cell
  activation → tissue damage (hallmark of TB disease).
  - Analogy: building a containment wall that also scars the neighborhood.

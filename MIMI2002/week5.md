# Function and features of the respiratory system, in healthy and diseased states.

1. Structure and Function of the Respiratory System
   - The respiratory tract is divided into upper (URT) and lower (LRT) regions, with
     distinct structures and exposures.
   - Upper Respiratory Tract (URT)
     - Includes: nose, nasal cavities, sinuses, pharynx, larynx.
     - Functions:
       - Air conduction (not gas exchange).
       - Robust epithelial surfaces protect against damage.
       - First line of defense with mucosal barriers and immune cells.
     - Exposure: high exposure to large particles, allergens, and pathogens.
   - Lower Respiratory Tract (LRT)
     - Includes: trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli (lungs).
     - Functions:
       - Trachea & bronchi → air movement, lined with mucociliary clearance system.
       - Alveoli → thin epithelium specialized for gas exchange.
     - Exposure: less direct exposure but highly vulnerable if pathogens bypass URT
       defenses.

2. Healthy State
   - Defenses:
     - Mechanical: mucociliary clearance, coughing, sneezing.
     - Innate immunity: alveolar macrophages, epithelial PRRs detecting pathogens.
     - Adaptive immunity: secretory IgA in URT, IgG in alveoli, T cell responses.
   - Gas exchange: efficient oxygen uptake and CO₂ removal in alveoli.
   - Immune tolerance: system balances between clearing pathogens and avoiding
     over-inflammation from harmless inhaled particles.

3. Diseased State – Infections
   - Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs)
     - Viral: rhinovirus, RSV, influenza → cause rhinitis (nasal inflammation),
       pharyngitis (throat inflammation).
     - Bacterial: Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes.
     - Fungal: rare, usually only in immunocompromised patients.
     - Symptoms: congestion, sore throat, mucus production, fever.
   - Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTIs)
     - Viral: influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2 → can cause pneumonia.
     - Bacterial: tuberculosis (Mycobacterium TB), Streptococcus pneumoniae,
       Legionella.
     - Fungal: Aspergillus, Histoplasma (mainly immunocompromised).
     - Symptoms:
       - Pneumonia (alveolar inflammation, fluid buildup).
       - Granulomas (immune aggregates, as in TB).
       - Impaired gas exchange → shortness of breath, hypoxia.

4. Key Differences Between URT and LRT
   - URT: first contact, robust epithelial surfaces, frequent viral infections.
   - LRT: specialized for gas exchange, thin epithelium more fragile, infections more
     severe (e.g., pneumonia).

# Resident microbes and the antimicrobial defences of the respiratory system.

1. Resident Microbes of the Respiratory System
   - Upper respiratory tract (URT):
     - Rich resident microbiota (e.g., Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Neisseria,
       anaerobes).
     - Constantly exposed to environmental microbes via inhalation.
     - Transient colonization is common, as many inhaled microbes do not persist.
   - Lower respiratory tract (LRT):
     - Once thought sterile, but now known to contain a low-density transient
       microbiota.
     - Has no stable resident flora like the URT.
     - The large surface area and delicate alveolar environment make it vulnerable
       if pathogens colonize.
   - Implication: URT infections are usually acute and self-limiting, while LRT
     infections are often chronic, severe, and harder to clear.

2. Antimicrobial Defenses of the Respiratory System
   - Mucus barrier (URT & LRT):
     - Secreted by goblet cells, traps microbes.
     - Contains lysozyme (breaks bacterial cell walls), lactoferrin (sequesters
       iron), and cationic antimicrobial peptides.
   - Mucociliary escalator (LRT):
     - Cilia move mucus and trapped microbes upward toward the throat to be
       swallowed.
   - Immune cells:
     - Neutrophils and macrophages patrol mucosa and alveoli.
     - PRRs (Pattern Recognition Receptors) detect PAMPs and trigger cytokine
       release.
   - Secretory antibodies:
     - IgA in URT mucosa prevents microbial attachment.
     - IgG in alveoli provides neutralization and opsonization.
   - Physical factors:
     - Coughing, sneezing, and airflow turbulence mechanically expel pathogens.

# Major microbial insults to respiratory system (morbidity and mortality) and their source and transmission.

Respiratory infections are the leading global cause of morbidity and mortality,
affecting millions each year.

1. Viral Infections
   - Examples: influenza, RSV, rhinoviruses, SARS-CoV-2.
   - Source & transmission: primarily spread by aerosols, droplets, and contact with
     contaminated surfaces.
   - Burden: cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics (e.g., influenza, COVID-19).

2. Bacterial Infections
   - URT bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes (pharyngitis), Bordetella pertussis
     (whooping cough).
   - LRT bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella.
   - Source & transmission: inhalation of droplets, contact, or reactivation of
     latent infections (e.g., TB).
   - Burden: pneumonia is a leading cause of death in children under 5; TB is a major
     global killer.

3. Fungal Infections
   - Examples: Aspergillus, Histoplasma.
   - Source & transmission: inhalation of spores from soil or environment.
   - Burden: usually only severe in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV,
     transplant patients).

4. Mechanisms of Pathogen-Driven Damage
   - Toxicological: pathogens secrete toxins (e.g., pertussis toxin damages ciliated
     cells).
   - Immunological: excessive immune responses (e.g., cytokine storm in influenza,
     COVID-19) damage host tissue.
   - Cytopathic: viruses replicate and kill host cells directly (e.g., RSV, influenza).

# The diversity of Streptococcus, Mycobacteria, Aspergillus, (LT11- and influenzavirus (including evolution of seasonal flu and emergence of pandemic flu)).

## Streptococcus

General Features of Streptococcus

- Gram-positive cocci arranged in chains.
- Important human pathogens causing high morbidity and mortality.
- Classified by:
  - Hemolysis on blood agar:
    - α-hemolysis (greenish partial lysis): e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae.
    - β-hemolysis (clear complete lysis): e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A).
    - γ-hemolysis (no hemolysis): non-pathogenic species.
  - Serotyping (Lancefield groups):
    - Group A: S. pyogenes.
    - Group B: S. agalactiae.
    - Non-groupable: S. pneumoniae.

1. Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus)
   - Epidemiology:
     - Leading global cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.
     - Accounts for ~25% of pneumonia cases worldwide.
     - Carriage: ~25% in adults, ~50% in children.
   - Pathogenesis:
     - Normally harmless commensal in URT.
     - In “at-risk” hosts (infants, elderly, influenza co-infection, chronic lung
       disease), spreads to LRT.
     - Disease arises from impaired lung clearance or dysregulated inflammation.
   - Virulence:
     - Capsule: anti-phagocytic.
     - Pneumolysin toxin: damages epithelium and immune cells.
     - Surface proteins aid adherence and invasion.
   - Clinical: Pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, bacteremia.
   - Treatment: Antibiotics (outcome depends on comorbidities).
   - Prevention: Vaccines (PCV13, PPSV23).

2. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS)
   - Epidemiology:
     - Human-restricted pathogen.
     - ~33 million cases/year; ~600,000 deaths globally.
     - Burden highest in rural tropical regions (e.g., NT Aboriginal communities in
       Australia).
   - Transmission: Aerosols or direct contact (wounds, skin).
   - Diseases:
     - URT: Pharyngitis (strep throat), scarlet fever.
     - Immune-mediated sequelae: Rheumatic fever/heart disease (RHD),
       glomerulonephritis.
     - Skin: Impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis.
   - Virulence Factors:
     - M protein (emm gene): attachment, immune evasion, major epidemiological
       marker.
     - Capsule: shields against phagocytosis.
     - Enzymes: degrade IgG, cytokines, DNA (escape NETs).
     - Superantigens (SpeA, SpeC): trigger massive T cell activation → immune damage.
   - Genomics:
     - ~2 Mb genome, ~2000 genes.
     - 1300 “core” genes + 6000 accessory genes.
     - emm-type diversity → explains strain-specific virulence and outbreaks.
     - Socio-geographic patterns: endemic diversity in rural tropics; epidemic
       outbreaks in temperate climates.
   - Clinical Presentation:
     - Red, swollen tonsils with exudate (strep throat).
     - Rash and fever in scarlet fever.
     - Impetigo skin lesions.
   - Treatment & Prevention:
     - No vaccine.
     - Prevention via hygiene (handwashing, covering coughs, wound care).
     - Antibiotics (penicillin, cephalosporins): reduce pharyngitis severity,
       prevent complications (RHD).

## Mycobacteria

1. General Characteristics
   - Belong to the genus Mycobacterium.
   - Defined by their slow growth and unique hydrophobic, waxy cell wall rich in
     mycolic acids.
   - This structure:
     - Makes them resistant to phagocytic clearance.
     - Allows survival and replication inside macrophages.
     - Requires acid-fast staining (Ziehl–Neelsen) for diagnostics, since Gram stain
       is ineffective.
   - Culture-based testing is slow, complicating rapid diagnosis and treatment
     decisions.

2. Pathogenic Diversity
   - Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)
     - M. tuberculosis → Main cause of tuberculosis (TB) in humans.
     - M. bovis → Primarily infects cattle but can infect humans ("reverse zoonosis").
     - M. africanum, M. microti, M. canettii → Regional or host-specific variants.
   - Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
     - Opportunistic pathogens (e.g., M. avium complex, M. kansasii, M. abscessus).
     - Cause lung infections, skin infections, and disseminated disease in
       immunocompromised hosts.
     - Increasingly recognized in cystic fibrosis and HIV/AIDS patients.

3. Infection Outcomes
   - Active TB disease
     - Highly infectious, airborne spread.
     - Causes severe lung pathology (cavities, granulomas).
     - Number 1 cause of infectious disease death globally.
   - Latent TB infection (LTBI)
     - ~90% of infected individuals control the infection → bacteria persist
       silently.
     - Carriers are not contagious but at risk of reactivation (especially with
       immunosuppression, HIV).
   - Disseminated TB
     - Bacteria spread beyond lungs → bone, CNS, lymph nodes.
     - Severe, life-threatening, especially in children and immunocompromised
       individuals.

4. Virulence Mechanisms
   - Mycolic acids → Protect against desiccation, antibiotics, and host defenses.
   - Intracellular survival proteins → Inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion, manipulate
     macrophage signaling.
   - Immune evasion → Modify cytokine signaling, persist in granulomas.
   - Host damage → Chronic immune stimulation causes tissue destruction
     (immunopathology).

5. Epidemiology & Burden
   - ~1.8 billion people globally infected (mostly latent).
   - ~10% lifetime risk of progressing to active TB.
   - TB disproportionately affects low-income countries.
   - COVID-19 pandemic worsened TB outcomes (diagnostic delays, treatment disruption).

6. Control, Treatment & Challenges
   - Prevention: BCG vaccine (over 100 years old, variable protection, mainly
     effective in children).
   - Treatment: Long-course combination antibiotic therapy (6–9 months).
   - Drug resistance:
     - MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant) → resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin.
     - XDR-TB (extensively drug-resistant) → resistant to fluoroquinolones and second-line drugs.
     - Huge global health challenge.

## Aspergillus

1. Introduction to Fungi
   - Fungi are eukaryotic organisms, with a cell structure more similar to human cells
     than bacteria.
   - They have a cell wall (chitin, glucans) and ergosterol-rich membranes, making
     antibacterial drugs ineffective.
   - Developing antifungals is challenging because of the similarity between fungal
     and human cells, leading to toxicity and side effects.

2. Fungal Infections of the Respiratory System
   - Fungal disease is termed mycosis.
   - Few fungi are primary human pathogens; most are opportunistic.
   - Fungal spores are abundant in the environment, small enough (2–20 μm) to be
     inhaled deeply into the lungs.
   - At-risk groups include:
     - Immunocompromised (e.g. chemotherapy, AIDS).
     - The very young or elderly.
     - Those with heavy environmental exposure (farmers, gardeners).

3. Aspergillus fumigatus – Key Pathogen
   - A filamentous, spore-forming mould, common in soil, compost, and decaying
     vegetation.
   - Spores (conidia) are airborne and can be inhaled.
   - Adaptable to temperature (grows at 37°C) and pH ranges, enabling survival in the
     lung.
   - Uses diverse nutrients, including structural proteins, making it a versatile
     colonizer.
   - Occupational exposure risk: agricultural workers, gardeners.

4. Aspergillus fumigatus Infection – Aspergillosis
   - In Immunocompetent Hosts:
     - Most spores cleared by alveolar macrophages and antifungal immune responses.
     - Rarely cause disease.
   - In Susceptible or Exposed Individuals:
     - Conidia (spores) can:
       1. Attach to alveolar epithelium.
       2. Invade via endocytosis.
       3. Germinate into hyphae.
       4. Escape immune cells.
       5. Disseminate via blood → systemic disease.
     - Clinical manifestations:
       - Farmer’s lung (allergic aspergillosis) – hypersensitivity reaction.
       - Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis – severe, high mortality (up to 80%).
       - Aspergilloma (“fungus ball”) – colonises lung cavities from prior
         diseases (e.g. TB scars).
       - Dissemination to brain and other organs in severe cases.

5. Treatment
   - Antifungals: Azoles (inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis), amphotericin B,
     echinocandins.
   - Treatment is difficult because:
     - Fungi resemble human cells → toxicity.
     - Resistance is emerging.
   - Side effects: hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, rashes.
   - Surgical resection may be required for aspergilloma.
   - Despite treatment, mortality remains high in invasive cases.

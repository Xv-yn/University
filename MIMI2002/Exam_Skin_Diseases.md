# Skin Diseases

## Staphylococcus aureus

Pathogenesis:

1. Enters skin through cuts, hair follicles, or damaged areas.
2. Evades phagocytosis using Protein A and capsule.
3. Releases leukocidins & hemolysins → kills WBCs → inflammation + pus.
4. Invasins break tissue barriers → spread through dermis.
5. Forms local infections (impetigo, folliculitis, boils).
6. Exfoliative toxins may act systemically → SSSS (skin peeling).

Virulence mechanism:

- Protein A → binds Fc of IgG backwards → blocks opsonization
- Capsule → prevents phagocytosis
- Leukocidins & hemolysins → destroy immune cells and RBCs
- Invasins → tissue penetration + spread

Causes symptoms:

- Impetigo → honey-crust lesions
- Folliculitis / furuncles / carbuncles → pus-filled nodules
- SSSS → red, tender skin peeling in sheets

## Streptococcus pyogenes

Pathogenesis:

1. Adheres to skin using M protein; capsule prevents phagocytosis.
2. Hyaluronidase and enzymes allow rapid tissue spread.
3. Streptolysins lyse WBCs → inflammation + tissue damage.
4. Spe toxins (A/C) act as superantigens → systemic disease.
5. SpeB protease destroys fascia → necrotizing fasciitis.

Virulence mechanism:

- M protein → immune evasion → pharyngitis / skin infection
- Streptolysin O/S → cell lysis → tissue destruction
- SpeA/SpeC → superantigens → cytokine storm
- Hyaluronidase → breaks connective tissue → spreads infection
- Hyaluronic acid capsule → mimics host tissue

Causes symptoms

- Impetigo → red sores
- Erysipelas → raised, sharply defined rash
- Cellulitis → deep, warm, swollen skin
- Necrotizing fasciitis → severe pain, rapidly spreading necrosis

## Clostridium perfringens

Pathogenesis:

1. Spores enter deep, anaerobic wounds.
2. Spores germinate and rapidly multiply.
3. α-toxin destroys cell membranes → massive necrosis.
4. Fermentation produces gas → tissue separation + crepitus.
5. Collagenase + hyaluronidase allow deep invasion.
6. Toxins enter bloodstream → shock.

Virulence mechanism:

- α-toxin (lecithinase) → cell membrane destruction
- Gas production → tissue splitting, crepitus
- Collagenase & hyaluronidase → tissue breakdown + spread
- Spores → survive environment, contaminate wounds

Causes symptoms:

- Gas gangrene → severe pain, blackened necrotic tissue, gas under skin
- Rapid progression → systemic toxicity and shock

## Dermatophytes

Pathogenesis:

1. Spores land on skin/nails (floors, showers, clothing).
2. Adhere to keratinized tissue and grow superficially.
3. Keratinases digest keratin → scaling rash / nail thickening.
4. LysM proteins hide fungus from immune system → chronic infection.
5. Stress-response pathways allow survival in sweat, pH shifts, friction.

Virulence mechanism:

- Keratinases → digest keratin for nutrients
- LysM proteins → immune evasion
- Environmental spores → high transmissibility
- Adaptation to keratinized tissue → superficial persistence
- Stress-response pathways → survive harsh skin environments

Causes symptoms:

- Tinea infections → ringworm rash, athlete’s foot, jock itch
- Onychomycosis → thick, brittle, discolored nails

## Human Papillomavirus (HPV)

Pathogenesis:

1. Virus infects basal epithelial cells via microabrasions.
2. Viral DNA persists episomally → long-term infection.
3. E6 blocks p53 → no apoptosis.
4. E7 blocks Rb → uncontrolled cell division.
5. Immune evasion (↓ IFN, ↓ PRR signalling) allows persistence.
6. Causes warts; long-term infection → dysplasia → cancer.

Virulence mechanism:

- E6 → destroys p53 (tumor suppressor)
- E7 → inactivates Rb (cell cycle control)
- Immune evasion → reduced PRR, IFN, MHC I/II
- Non-enveloped capsid → stable on surfaces
- Episomal persistence → chronic infection

Causes symptoms:

- Warts (skin, genital, plantar)
- Cervical / oropharyngeal cancers in persistent high-risk strains

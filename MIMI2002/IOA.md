## Chlamydia trachomatis Infection Strategy

Chlamydia is an **obligated intracellular bacterium**.

- “Obligate” = must. The organism cannot survive or replicate outside host cells.
- “Intracellular” = it lives inside the host cell rather than floating around outside in tissue or
  blood.
- “Bacterium” = it’s a prokaryotic microorganism (not a virus, though it behaves somewhat like one).

1. Entry into the Body
   - Usually transmitted sexually (urogenital tract), but it can also be passed from mother to baby
     during birth → eye or lung infections in the newborn.

2. Elementary Body (EB) — The Infectious Form
   - Outside of cells, Chlamydia exists as an elementary body.
   - Think of it like a spore: small, tough, and designed to survive outside cells until it finds a
     new host.
   - It attaches to epithelial cells (the surface cells lining the genital tract, eye, or respiratory
     tract).

3. Cell Entry
   - The EB binds to receptors on the host cell surface (e.g. heparan sulfate, integrins).
   - The host cell pulls it inside via endocytosis → it’s now inside a little bubble (a vacuole).

4. Reticulate Body (RB) — The Replicating Form
   - Once inside, the EB transforms into a reticulate body (RB).
   - RBs are larger and metabolically active but not infectious.
   - They divide by binary fission (just like other bacteria) inside the vacuole, which becomes an
     inclusion body (a protective bubble).

5. Multiplication and Evasion
   - Chlamydia avoids being digested by the host by blocking fusion with lysosomes.
     - It releases specific inclusion membrane proteins (Inc proteins) that insert into the vacuole
       membrane, altering its identity so the host cell treats it like a normal organelle instead
       of a pathogen.
   - It steals nutrients and ATP from the host.
   - The RBs multiply until the inclusion is packed.

6. Back to Elementary Bodies
   - After replication, RBs convert back into EBs.
   - These EBs are now ready to infect new cells.

7. Release
   - The host cell either:
     - Bursts (lysis) → releasing lots of EBs all at once, or
     - Exocytosis → pushes them out more gently.
   - EBs spread to nearby cells → the infection cycle continues.

## Immune Response to Chlamydia

### Innate Immune Response (First Responders)

- Epithelial cell sensing
  - Infected epithelial cells recognize Chlamydia through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like
    TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, and NOD receptors.
  - They release pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8).
  - Effect: recruits neutrophils and macrophages to the site.

- Neutrophils
  - Arrive quickly → attack bacteria with reactive oxygen species and enzymes.
  - Cause pus/discharge (lots of neutrophils in conjunctivitis or genital infection).

- Macrophages & NK cells
  - Macrophages try to phagocytose bacteria, but Chlamydia resists degradation inside them.
  - NK cells release IFN-γ → activates macrophages and begins pushing the system toward a Th1
    response.

- Innate limitation
  - Chlamydia is intracellular and hides in inclusion vacuoles → innate system alone can’t clear it
    fully.
  - Innate response buys time until the adaptive system kicks in.

### Adaptive Immune Response (Specific Defenders)

- Cell-mediated (most important)
  - CD4+ Th1 cells are the key players.
  - They produce IFN-γ → activates macrophages to better kill infected cells.
  - IFN-γ also pushes infected epithelial cells to destroy the inclusions.
  - CD8+ T cells can kill infected cells directly (cytotoxic response), though they are less
    dominant than CD4 Th1.

- Humoral (antibody) response
  - IgA (mucosal antibody) helps limit reinfection on genital/eye surfaces.
  - IgG develops and can help opsonize bacteria.
  - But: antibodies are not fully protective, because Chlamydia hides inside cells most of the time.

# GIT Diseases

## Salmonella gastroenteritis

Pathogenesis:

1. Ingested via contaminated food (poultry, eggs, reptiles).
2. Survives stomach acid → reaches small intestine.
3. Invades M cells and enterocytes.
4. Induces inflammation via Type III secretion system → cytokine release.
5. Causes fluid secretion + neutrophilic inflammation → diarrhea.

Virulence mechanism:

- Type III secretion systems → inject effector proteins into host cells
- Intracellular survival inside macrophages
- LPS endotoxin → inflammation + fever

Causes symptoms:

- Watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea
- Fever
- Abdominal cramps
- Nausea/vomiting

## Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)

Pathogenesis:

1. Ingested via contaminated water/food (traveler’s diarrhea).
2. Adheres to small intestinal epithelium via fimbriae (CFA).
3. Produces LT (heat-labile) and ST (heat-stable) toxins.
4. Toxins stimulate chloride and water secretion.
5. Leads to profuse watery diarrhea.

Virulence mechanism:

- LT toxin → ↑ cAMP → fluid secretion
- ST toxin → ↑ cGMP → decreased NaCl absorption
- Colonization factor antigens → adherence to mucosa

Causes symptoms:

- Watery “rice-water–like” diarrhea
- Abdominal cramping
- Dehydration
- No fever (usually)

## Clostridium botulinum

Pathogenesis:

1. Ingest ingestion of spores (infants) or preformed toxin (adults).
2. Botulinum toxin absorbed from gut → enters bloodstream.
3. Toxin blocks ACh release at neuromuscular junction.
4. Leads to flaccid paralysis.
5. Respiratory muscles may fail in severe cases.

Virulence mechanism:

- Botulinum neurotoxin → cleaves SNARE proteins → prevents ACh release
- Spores survive in soil/honey/canned foods
- Anaerobic growth allows toxin production

Causes symptoms:

- Descending flaccid paralysis
- Diplopia, ptosis
- Dysphagia, dry mouth
- Constipation (due to gut paralysis)
- Respiratory failure in severe cases

## Norovirus

Pathogenesis:

1. Ingested via food, surfaces, vomiting droplets (highly infectious).
2. Infects small intestinal enterocytes.
3. Causes blunted villi → malabsorption.
4. Triggers hypermotility + secretions.
5. Rapid onset vomiting and diarrhea.

Virulence mechanism:

- Extremely low infectious dose (as few as 10 particles)
- Environmental stability (non-enveloped virus)
- Vomiting aerosols → rapid person-to-person spread
- Evasion of innate immunity

Causes symptoms:

- Sudden onset vomiting
- Watery diarrhea
- Low-grade fever
- Dehydration
- Very common on cruise ships, schools, daycares

## Poliovirus

Pathogenesis:

1. Fecal-oral entry → replicates in oropharynx + gut.
2. Spreads to lymph nodes → transient viremia.
3. In rare cases, crosses blood-brain barrier.
4. Infects anterior horn motor neurons of spinal cord.
5. Leads to muscle weakness and paralysis.

Virulence mechanism:

- Acid-stable capsid → survives stomach acid
- Replication in motor neurons → cell lysis
- Immune evasion during viremia

Causes symptoms:

- Mostly asymptomatic
- Mild “flu-like” illness
- Paralytic poliomyelitis: asymmetric flaccid paralysis
- Respiratory muscle paralysis in severe cases

## Adenovirus (GI strains)

Pathogenesis:

1. Fecal-oral transmission → infects intestinal epithelial cells.
2. Enters via CAR receptor (coxsackie–adenovirus receptor).
3. Viral replication causes cell lysis → inflammation.
4. Persistent infection possible in lymphoid tissue.
5. Causes prolonged diarrhea, especially in children.

Virulence mechanism:

- Non-enveloped stability → survives on surfaces, pools, toys
- Early proteins block apoptosis and interfere with host immunity
- Fiber proteins aid in attachment to enterocytes

Causes symptoms:

- Watery diarrhea (often prolonged)
- Fever
- Vomiting
- Common in children, daycares, swimming pools

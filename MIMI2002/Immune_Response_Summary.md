# Immune Response

## Innate Immune Response

1. Pathogen (Foreign Substance) enters the body.
   - It may infect an epithelial cell,
   - Infect other nearby cells or
   - Float freely in extracellular fluids.

2. The epithelial cells would detect the pathogen via PRRs (Pattern Recognition
   Receptors) and release cytokines, specifically:
   - **IFN-α and IFN-β** (Type 1 Inteferons) → activates NK (Natural Killer) Cells.
     - **NK Cells**:
       - Recognize and kill infected or abnormal cells that have a reduced MHC I
         expression.
       - Kill cells by releasing releasing **perforin** and **granzymes** to induce
         apoptosis.
   - **IL-1, IL-6** (Interleukins), **TNF-α** → promotes inflammation and recruit
     immune cells to the infection site.

3. The released cytokines signal resident macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes to
   approach the infection site.
   - **Resident Macrophages and Dendritic Cells** recognize pathogens via **PAMPs
     (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns)**
   - **Neutrophils** can attack pathogens in the following ways:
     - **ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species)**: Release of toxic molecules such as **superoxide
       radicals** and **hydrogen peroxide** that damage and kill microbes.
     - **Degranulation**: Release of antimicrobial enzymes (e.g., defensins,
       proteases).
     - **NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)**: A self-destructing DNA web
       structures that trap and kill pathogens.
   - **Monocytes** differentiate into Macrophages or Dendritic Cells
     - **Macrophages** are formed in "warzone" areas and attack pathogens in the
       following ways:
       - Macrophages engulf pathogens to form a phagosome (a vacuole with the pathogen
         inside it) and fuses it with:
         - **ROS**
         - **Lysosomal Enzymes**: proteases, lipases and lysozomes that degrade bacterial
           cell walls.
         - **Acidification**: the phagosome becomes highly acidic.
       - Can present antigens
     - **Dendritic Cells** are formed in "wasteland" areas
       - Captures antigens in "wastelands"
       - Matures and presents captured antigen.
       - Migrates to lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels.

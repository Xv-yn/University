# Activation of CD8 Cytotoxic T Cells (CTLs) During Infection

> [!NOTE]
> CTL = Cytotoxic C Lymphocytes

1. Antigen Presentation and Recognition
   - Viruses are intracellular pathogens, so viral proteins are made inside host
     cells and degraded by the proteasome into peptides.
   - These peptides are displayed on MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.
   - Naïve CD8+ T cells with TCRs (T Cell Receptors) specific for these
     MHC-I: viral peptide complexes are activated in secondary lymphoid organs.

2. Two-Signal Activation
   - Signal 1: TCR recognition of MHC-I:viral peptide on antigen-presenting cells
     (APCs).
   - Signal 2: Co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD28–B7 interaction) and cytokines
     provided by the APC.

3. CD4+ T Cell Help
   - Th1 CD4+ helper T cells aid CD8+ activation by:
     - Secreting IFN-γ and expressing CD40L, which enhances APC function.
     - Upregulating MHC-I/II and co-stimulatory molecules.
     - Secreting IL-2, promoting clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells.

4. Cross-Presentation
   - When viruses infect non-APCs (e.g. epithelial cells), dendritic cells (DCs) can
     phagocytose viral antigens and present them on MHC-I via cross-presentation.

5. Outcome
   - Only T cells recognizing the MHC-I:viral peptide complex proliferate,
     differentiate into effector CTLs, and migrate to infection sites.

# Mechanisms Used by CTLs and NK Cells to Eradicate Infected Cells

1. CTL Killing Mechanisms
   - Once activated, CTLs require no further co-stimulation to kill target cells.
   - They identify infected cells via the same MHC-I:viral peptide that triggered
     their activation.

2. Killing Pathways
   - Perforin–Granzyme Pathway
     - Perforin forms pores in the target cell membrane.
     - Granzymes enter through the pores, activating apoptosis (programmed cell
       death).
     - This killing is specific; neighboring cells remain unharmed.
   - Fas–FasL Pathway
     - CTLs express Fas ligand (FasL) which binds to Fas (CD95) on the infected
       cell.
     - This triggers the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis.
     - Still requires recognition of the MHC-I: peptide.
   - Recycling
     - After killing, CTLs can detach and move to other targets.

3. NK Cell Killing
   - NK cells target cells with low or absent MHC-I (e.g. when viruses suppress MHC
     expression).
   - “Missing self” hypothesis:
     - Normal cells express MHC-I, which engages inhibitory receptors on NK cells →
       no killing.
     - Infected or stressed cells downregulate MHC-I → inhibitory signal lost → NK
       activation.
     - NK cells kill via perforin and granzymes, like CTLs.

# Composition and Functions of BCRs and Antibodies

1. BCR Structure
   - Membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig).
   - Has:
     - Variable (V) regions → Antigen-specific recognition.
     - Constant (C) regions → Determines class and function.
   - Associated signaling molecules trigger activation.
   - Can be secreted by plasma cells as antibodies.

2. Antibody Isotypes (Classes)
   - Determined by heavy-chain type (μ, δ, γ, ε, α):
     - IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, IgA
   - Light chains: κ or λ.
   - Isotype = function
     - IgA → mucosal defense (dimer)
     - IgM → first antibody produced, strong agglutination (pentamer)
     - IgG → main serum antibody, crosses placenta
     - IgE → allergy and parasite defense
     - IgD → receptor on naïve B cells

# Generation of BCR Diversity

- Arises from V(D)J recombination in bone marrow.
  - RAG-1 and RAG-2 enzymes mediate recombination.
  - Heavy chain rearranges first → pre-B cell.
  - Light chain rearranges next → immature B cell with surface IgM.
- Combinatorial diversity: many possible V, D, and J segment combinations.
- Junctional diversity: random nucleotide additions or deletions.
- Somatic hypermutation (later, in germinal centers) further refines specificity.

# Maturation of B Cells

- In the Bone Marrow
  - Pro-B cell stage: rearranges heavy chain.
  - Pre-B cell stage: expresses pre-BCR.
  - Immature B cell: expresses IgM.
  - Mature naïve B cell: co-expresses IgM and IgD, leaves bone marrow.

- Selection Steps
  - Positive selection: ensures functional BCR expression (not antigen specificity).
  - Negative selection: deletes or edits self-reactive B cells via receptor editing
    of the light chain.

- Peripheral Maturation
  - Mature naïve B cells enter lymph nodes and spleen awaiting antigen encounter.

- Special B Cell Types
  - B-1 B cells: innate-like, secrete natural IgM antibodies.
  - Regulatory B cells: secrete IL-10, suppress immune responses, and promote Tregs.

# Activation of Naïve B Cells

Naïve B cells express IgM and IgD as surface receptors (BCRs).

These BCRs recognize antigens such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and nucleic
acids.

When an antigen binds, Igα and Igβ transmit activation signals.

Activation is enhanced if:

- The microbe also activates a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) or
- Engages complement receptor 2 (CR2).

Activated B cells:

- Begin secreting IgM.
- Enter the cell cycle (proliferate).
- Upregulate MHC-II for antigen presentation.
- Increase expression of cytokine receptors.

# B Cell Activation by Protein Antigens & the Germinal Centre Reaction

Step 1: B Cell Antigen Processing

- B cells endocytose protein antigens after BCR binding.
- Antigens are processed and presented on MHC-II molecules.
- CD4⁺ helper T cells recognize these peptides — a T-dependent response.

Step 2: T–B Cell Interaction

- In lymph nodes:
  - Dendritic cells (DCs) activate CD4⁺ T cells in the T cell zone.
  - Naïve B cells are activated by the same antigen in the follicle.
  - Activated T and B cells migrate to meet at the T–B border, where CD40–CD40L and
    cytokine signals occur.

Step 3: Extrafollicular Response

- Some activated B cells proliferate and differentiate into short-lived plasma cells.
- Produce mainly IgM (some isotype switching possible).
- A few activated B cells return to the follicle, forming a germinal centre (GC).

Step 4: Germinal Centre Reaction

- Inside the GC:
  - Massive proliferation of B cells.
  - Isotype (class) switching.
  - Somatic hypermutation (SHM) → changes in the V region.
  - Affinity maturation → selection for higher-affinity antibodies.
- B cells interact with:
  - T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (provide help via cytokines and CD40L).
  - Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (present native antigen).

Step 5: Outcomes

- High-affinity B cells survive and differentiate into:
- Long-lived plasma cells (antibody secretion).
- Memory B cells (rapid response upon re-exposure).

# Steps in Isotype Switching

- Mediated by CD40L–CD40 interaction and cytokines from helper T cells.
- Different cytokines → different isotypes:
  - IFN-γ → IgG subclasses (for opsonization and complement activation).
  - IL-4 → IgE (for parasite defense, allergy).
  - TGF-β → IgA (for mucosal immunity).

Mechanism:

1. CD40L activates AID (Activation-Induced cytidine Deaminase) in B cells.
2. AID induces DNA breaks in “switch regions” upstream of constant (C) genes.
3. Recombination joins a new C region with the existing V(D)J segment.
4. The variable region (antigen-binding site) remains the same — specificity is
   unchanged, only function changes.

# Affinity Maturation

- Driven by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection in the germinal centre.
- AID enzyme introduces point mutations in the V regions of the antibody genes.
- Occurs in the dark zone of the GC.
- B cells then migrate to the light zone:
  - Compete for binding to antigen on FDCs.
  - Higher-affinity BCRs successfully bind antigen and present it to Tfh cells.
  - Receive survival signals; others undergo apoptosis.
- Repeated cycles of mutation and selection → progressively higher-affinity antibodies.

# T-Dependent vs T-Independent Antigens

| Feature                     | **T-Dependent (TD)**                | **T-Independent (TI)**                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Antigen type**            | Protein                             | Polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids |
| **Requires T cell help?**   | Yes (CD4⁺ T cells)                  | No                                     |
| **Isotype switching**       | Extensive (IgG, IgA, IgE)           | Limited (mostly IgM)                   |
| **Affinity maturation**     | Strong                              | Weak                                   |
| **Memory B cell formation** | Yes                                 | Limited                                |
| **Typical response**        | Long-lasting, high affinity         | Short-lived, low affinity              |
| **Importance**              | Key for protein antigens & vaccines | Defense against encapsulated bacteria  |

# How Antibodies Prevent & Eliminate Infections

1. Neutralization
   - Antibodies (mainly IgA and IgG) bind pathogens or toxins.
   - Block binding to host cells → prevent infection and toxin entry.
   - Major mechanism of vaccine-induced protection.

2. Opsonization
   - Antibodies tag microbes for phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils (via
     Fc receptors).

3. Complement Activation
   - IgG and IgM activate the classical complement pathway, leading to pathogen
     lysis and inflammation.

4. ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity)
   - IgG binds to viral proteins on infected cells.
   - NK cells recognize Fc region (via CD16/FcγRIII) and kill infected cells.

5. Mucosal Immunity
   - IgA at mucosal surfaces neutralizes pathogens before they invade epithelial
     barriers.

# IgA and IgG – Properties & Effector Functions

- IgA
  - Main mucosal antibody (GI & respiratory tract).
  - Accounts for ~2/3 of daily antibody production.
  - Produced in mucosal lymphoid tissue (e.g., Peyer’s patches).
  - TGF-β drives class switching to IgA.
  - Exists as a dimer joined by the J chain.
  - Transported across epithelium via poly-Ig receptor; released with secretory
    component.
  - Found in mucus, saliva, tears, and breast milk.
  - Function: Neutralizes viruses and toxins at mucosal sites to prevent infection.

- IgG
  - Most abundant in blood and tissues.
  - Functions:
    - Neutralization of microbes/toxins.
    - Opsonization → enhances phagocytosis.
    - Complement activation.
    - ADCC via NK cells.
    - Crosses placenta to provide neonatal immunity.
  - Key for systemic immunity (e.g., Salk vaccine).

# Activation of CD8 Cytotoxic T Cells (CTLs) During Infection

> [!NOTE]
> CTL = Cytotoxic C Lymphocytes

1. Antigen Presentation and Recognition
   - Viruses are intracellular pathogens, so viral proteins are made inside host
     cells and degraded by the proteasome into peptides.
   - These peptides are displayed on MHC-I molecules on the cell surface.
   - Naïve CD8+ T cells with TCRs (T Cell Receptors) specific for these
     MHC-I: viral peptide complexes are activated in secondary lymphoid organs.

2. Two-Signal Activation
   - Signal 1: TCR recognition of MHC-I:viral peptide on antigen-presenting cells
     (APCs).
   - Signal 2: Co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD28–B7 interaction) and cytokines
     provided by the APC.

3. CD4+ T Cell Help
   - Th1 CD4+ helper T cells aid CD8+ activation by:
     - Secreting IFN-γ and expressing CD40L, which enhances APC function.
     - Upregulating MHC-I/II and co-stimulatory molecules.
     - Secreting IL-2, promoting clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells.

4. Cross-Presentation
   - When viruses infect non-APCs (e.g. epithelial cells), dendritic cells (DCs) can
     phagocytose viral antigens and present them on MHC-I via cross-presentation.

5. Outcome
   - Only T cells recognizing the MHC-I:viral peptide complex proliferate,
     differentiate into effector CTLs, and migrate to infection sites.

# Mechanisms Used by CTLs and NK Cells to Eradicate Infected Cells

1. CTL Killing Mechanisms
   - Once activated, CTLs require no further co-stimulation to kill target cells.
   - They identify infected cells via the same MHC-I:viral peptide that triggered
     their activation.

2. Killing Pathways
   - Perforin–Granzyme Pathway
     - Perforin forms pores in the target cell membrane.
     - Granzymes enter through the pores, activating apoptosis (programmed cell
       death).
     - This killing is specific; neighboring cells remain unharmed.
   - Fas–FasL Pathway
     - CTLs express Fas ligand (FasL) which binds to Fas (CD95) on the infected
       cell.
     - This triggers the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis.
     - Still requires recognition of the MHC-I: peptide.
   - Recycling
     - After killing, CTLs can detach and move to other targets.

3. NK Cell Killing
   - NK cells target cells with low or absent MHC-I (e.g. when viruses suppress MHC
     expression).
   - “Missing self” hypothesis:
     - Normal cells express MHC-I, which engages inhibitory receptors on NK cells →
       no killing.
     - Infected or stressed cells downregulate MHC-I → inhibitory signal lost → NK
       activation.
     - NK cells kill via perforin and granzymes, like CTLs.

# Composition and Functions of BCRs and Antibodies

1. BCR Structure
   - Membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig).
   - Has:
     - Variable (V) regions → Antigen-specific recognition.
     - Constant (C) regions → Determines class and function.
   - Associated signaling molecules trigger activation.
   - Can be secreted by plasma cells as antibodies.

2. Antibody Isotypes (Classes)
   - Determined by heavy-chain type (μ, δ, γ, ε, α):
     - IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, IgA
   - Light chains: κ or λ.
   - Isotype = function
     - IgA → mucosal defense (dimer)
     - IgM → first antibody produced, strong agglutination (pentamer)
     - IgG → main serum antibody, crosses placenta
     - IgE → allergy and parasite defense
     - IgD → receptor on naïve B cells

# Generation of BCR Diversity

- Arises from V(D)J recombination in bone marrow.
  - RAG-1 and RAG-2 enzymes mediate recombination.
  - Heavy chain rearranges first → pre-B cell.
  - Light chain rearranges next → immature B cell with surface IgM.
- Combinatorial diversity: many possible V, D, and J segment combinations.
- Junctional diversity: random nucleotide additions or deletions.
- Somatic hypermutation (later, in germinal centers) further refines specificity.

# Maturation of B Cells

- In the Bone Marrow
  - Pro-B cell stage: rearranges heavy chain.
  - Pre-B cell stage: expresses pre-BCR.
  - Immature B cell: expresses IgM.
  - Mature naïve B cell: co-expresses IgM and IgD, leaves bone marrow.

- Selection Steps
  - Positive selection: ensures functional BCR expression (not antigen specificity).
  - Negative selection: deletes or edits self-reactive B cells via receptor editing
    of the light chain.

- Peripheral Maturation
  - Mature naïve B cells enter lymph nodes and spleen awaiting antigen encounter.

- Special B Cell Types
  - B-1 B cells: innate-like, secrete natural IgM antibodies.
  - Regulatory B cells: secrete IL-10, suppress immune responses, and promote Tregs.

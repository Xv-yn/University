# Immune Response

## Innate Immune Response

0. Complement Proteins circulate throughout the entire body.
   - All complement proteins do the following:
     - Slime coating (C3b)
     - Alarm signal (C3a, C5a)
     - Killing machine (MAC)
   - However, they are activated differently
     - Classical Pathway
       - Activated when bound to specific antibodies (IgG or IgM)
     - Lectin Pathway
       - Activated when bound to a specific microbe carbohydrate pattern
     - Alternative Pathway
       - Activated when bound to a microbial surface and is not inactivated

1. Pathogen (Foreign Substance) enters the body.
   - It may infect an epithelial cell,
   - Infect other nearby cells or
   - Float freely in extracellular fluids.

2. The epithelial cells would detect the pathogen via PRRs (Pattern Recognition
   Receptors), and release cytokines, specifically:
   - **IFN-α and IFN-β** (Type 1 Inteferons) → activates NK (Natural Killer) Cells.
     - **NK Cells**:
       - Recognize and kill infected or abnormal cells that have a reduced MHC I
         expression.
       - Kill cells by releasing releasing **perforin** and **granzymes** to induce
         apoptosis.

   - **IL-1, IL-6** (Interleukins), **TNF-α** → promotes inflammation and recruit
     immune cells to the infection site.

3. The released cytokines activate resident macrophages, and recruit neutrophils and
   monocytes to approach the infection site.
   - **Resident Macrophages and Dendritic Cells** recognize pathogens via **PAMPs
     (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns)**

   - **Neutrophils** can attack pathogens in the following ways:
     - **ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species)**: Release of toxic molecules such as
       **superoxide radicals** and **hydrogen peroxide** that damage and kill
       microbes.
     - **Degranulation**: Release of antimicrobial enzymes (e.g., defensins,
       proteases).
     - **NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)**: A self-destructing DNA web
       structures that trap and kill pathogens.

   - **Monocytes** differentiate into Macrophages or Dendritic Cells
     - **Macrophages** are formed in "warzone" areas and attack pathogens in the
       following ways:
       - "warzone areas" being inflammatory environments: TNF, IL-1, GM-CSF
       - Macrophages engulf pathogens to form a phagosome (a vacuole with the pathogen
         inside it) and fuses it with:
         - **ROS**
         - **Lysosomal Enzymes**: proteases, lipases and lysozomes that degrade
           bacterial cell walls.
         - **Acidification**: the phagosome becomes highly acidic.
       - Can present antigens

     - **Dendritic Cells** are formed in "wasteland" areas
       - "wasteland areas" being non-inflammatory (IL-4, GM-CSF) environment.
       - Captures antigens in "wastelands"
       - Matures and presents captured antigen.
       - Migrates to lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels.

## Adaptive Immune Response

1. Mature Dendritic Cells and free floating antigens migrate to the lymph nodes via
   lymphatic vessels.

2. Mature DCs travel directly to the paracortex (Where naive T cells reside) while
   Subscapular Sinus (SCS) Macrophages "bring" the free floating antigens to the
   cortex (where naive B cells reside).

3. The naive B cells bind to the free floating antigen, leading to a "half activation".
   The Mature DCs "touch" various CD8 naive T cells and CD4 naive T cells depending on
   if it present MHC II or I respectively.

4. Once the Mature DCs bind to the CD8 Naive T Cell, they activate to form a Cytotoxic
   T Cell. These Cytotoxic T cells are released into the body and kill any infected
   host cells via perforins and/or granzymes.

5. Once the Mature DCs bind to the CD4 naive T cell, they activate to form a CD4 Helper
   T Cell. It's "flavours" depends on the cytokines released by the Mature DC.

| **T-Helper Subset**                 | **Main Function**                                                          | **Key Role / When It’s Used**                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **TH1**                             | Activates macrophages                                                      | Intracellular bacteria, viruses                    |
| **TH2**                             | Helps B cells make antibodies (especially IgE)                             | Parasites (helminths), allergies                   |
| **TH17**                            | Recruits neutrophils                                                       | Extracellular bacteria, fungi                      |
| **Tfh** (Follicular Helper T Cells) | Helps B cells fully activate; drives class-switching & affinity maturation | Germinal center reactions; high-quality antibodies |
| **Treg**                            | Suppresses immune responses; maintains tolerance                           | Prevents autoimmunity; controls inflammation       |

- The CD4 Helper T cells can differentiate into various subsets e.g. TH1, TH2, Tfh
  but not TH17 or Treg.

6. In the case that Tfh CD4 Helper T cell forms, the Tfh travels to the cortex, where
   it binds to the B cell that was half activated in step 3.
   - This will cause the B cell to fully activate and turn into memory cells or plasma
     cells which secrete antibodies.

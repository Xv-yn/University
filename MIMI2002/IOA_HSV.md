# Treponema pallidum Infection Strategy

1. Transmission & Entry
   - Spread by sexual contact, skin-to-skin mucosal contact, or from mother to
     baby at birth.
   - Infects mucosal epithelial cells of the genital tract.
   - Virus `attaches using glycoproteins (e.g., gB, gD)` that `bind to host
receptors (nectin-1, HVEM)`.
   - Enters cells via `membrane fusion or endocytosis`.

2. Lytic Infection (Primary Phase)
   - Once inside epithelial cells:
     - The viral DNA is released into the nucleus.
     - Viral genes are expressed in a `cascade`: immediate-early → early → late proteins.
     - Host machinery is hijacked to replicate viral DNA and assemble new virions.
   - Infected epithelial cells eventually lyse → releasing new viruses.
   - This causes painful genital ulcers, sometimes with systemic flu-like symptoms.

3. Spread to Nerve Cells
   - HSV-2 doesn’t just stay in epithelial cells.
   - Newly made virions `infect sensory nerve endings` at the site of infection.
   - Viral particles travel retrograde along axons to the `sacral dorsal root
ganglia` (sensory neuron cell bodies).

4. Latency (Viral Hibernation)
   - In neurons, the viral genome remains as a circular episome (not integrated).
   - Almost all viral genes are silenced → only `latency-associated transcripts`
     (LATs) are made.
   - LATs help suppress apoptosis and keep the virus hidden from immune detection.
   - Neurons survive, and no virus is produced → clinically silent stage.

5. Reactivation & Recurrence
   - Stress, fever, immunosuppression, trauma, or hormonal changes can trigger
     reactivation.
   - Virus reactivates in neurons, travels anterograde back down the axon to
     the skin/mucosa.
   - Causes recurrent genital lesions (usually milder than primary).
   - Cycles of latency ↔ reactivation explain why HSV-2 is lifelong.

## Immune Evasion

- Latency = hiding in neurons (immune privileged, low MHC expression).
- Blocks antigen presentation → HSV proteins (ICP47) inhibit TAP transporter,
  so viral peptides don’t reach MHC-I.
- Inhibits apoptosis → LATs and other proteins keep neurons alive.
- Glycoprotein mimicry → helps evade antibodies.

# Immune Response to Treponema pallidum

## Innate Immune Response (First Responders)

1. Infected epithelial cells
   - Detect HSV DNA/proteins via TLRs, cGAS–STING pathway.
   - Release type I interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β) → antiviral state in neighboring
     cells.
   - Also release IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6 → inflammation.

2. Natural Killer (NK) cells
   - HSV-2 reduces MHC-I expression on infected cells (to avoid CD8 T cells).
   - But NK cells kill cells with low MHC-I → important early control.

3. Complement
   - Neutralizes some free virions.
   - HSV glycoproteins can bind and inactivate complement, so effect is partial.

## Adaptive Immune Response (Specific Defenders)

1. B cells / Antibodies
   - IgA (mucosal) and IgG form.
   - Antibodies can neutralize virions outside cells, block spread, and help
     opsonization.
   - But: antibodies can’t touch virus hiding inside neurons.

2. CD8+ T cells (Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes)
   - Critical for containing HSV in latency.
   - Patrol the dorsal root ganglia → release IFN-γ to suppress reactivation.
   - They don’t usually kill the neuron (that would be catastrophic), but they
     keep the virus “quiet.”

3. CD4+ T cells (Helper T cells)
   - Support CD8 T cells and B cells.
   - Promote IFN-γ production and antibody generation.

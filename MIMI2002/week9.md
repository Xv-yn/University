# Structure and Function of the Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT)

## Structure overview

Major organs: mouth → esophagus → stomach → small intestine (duodenum, jejunum,
ileum) → large intestine (caecum, ascending, transverse, descending colon) →
rectum → anus.

Accessory organs: salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, pancreas.

Functions: digestion, absorption, excretion, and microbial homeostasis.

Healthy state:

- Coordinated peristalsis moves food and microbes along.
- Stomach acidity (pH ~4) and bile salts inhibit pathogens.
- Mucosal layers act as physical and chemical barriers.
- Immune system and gut microbiota maintain protective balance.

Diseased state:

- Disruption of barriers or microbiota → infections (bacterial, viral, or protist)
  and dysbiosis.
- Common symptoms: diarrhea, inflammation, malabsorption, systemic infection.

Defensive mechanisms:

- Acidity: kills most ingested microbes.
- Enzymes & bile: digest and neutralize pathogens.
- Mucosal immunity: tight epithelial junctions, antimicrobial peptides, mucus layer.
- Microbiota: competes with pathogens, regulates immune responses.

# Diversity of the Normal Gastrointestinal Microbiota

Distribution:

- Few microbes: in the stomach and small intestine (low pH, high oxygen).
- Many microbes: in the large intestine (anaerobic, neutral pH).
- Gradient: bacteria density increases along the GI tract.

Common genera:

- Mouth: Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces.
- Stomach: Helicobacter.
- Small intestine: Lactobacillus, Streptococcus.
- Large intestine: Bacteroides, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium,
  Escherichia, Enterococcus, Akkermansia.

Ecological features:

- Anaerobic environment; slow transit allows colonization.
- Faeces are ~50% microbes (alive/dead).
- Microbiota diversity affected by diet, antibiotics, and lifestyle.

Diet and microbiota:

- High-fibre diet: promotes symbiosis, diversity, SCFA (short-chain fatty acid)
  production (e.g. butyrate, acetate, propionate).
- Low-fibre, high-fat/sugar diet: causes dysbiosis, reduced diversity, and
  inflammation.

# How Normal Microbiota Protect the GIT from Infection

Protective roles:

- Competition: outcompete pathogens for nutrients and attachment sites.
- Chemical defence: produce antimicrobial compounds (bacteriocins, colicins, SCFAs).
- Environmental maintenance: keep low oxygen levels, acidic microenvironment.
- Immune modulation: stimulate host immune cells and strengthen epithelial barrier.
- Nutritional support: produce vitamins and provide energy to colonocytes (via SCFAs).

Illustrations:

- Commensal bacteria forming a protective layer, secreting
  antimicrobials, and blocking pathogen colonization.

Dysbiosis:

- Disrupted microbiota → weakened immunity, increased infection risk (e.g.
  inflammatory bowel disease).

# Comparing Bacterial, Viral, and Protist GI Infections

| **Mechanism**  | Exotoxins, invasion, inflammation           | Invades epithelial cells, causes lysis | Adheres to mucosa, forms cysts/trophozoites     |

# Epidemiology, Transmission, Pathology, Virulence, Host Response, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Control

## Botulism (Clostridium botulinum)

Type: Non-diarrhoeal bacterial disease.

Pathogen: Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe.

Transmission: via contaminated food/water or preformed toxin (infection or
intoxication).

Pathogenesis: spores germinate → produce AB neurotoxin → blocks acetylcholine
release → paralysis.

Symptoms: muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing/breathing, double vision, nausea.

Diagnosis: detect toxin in serum/stool/food, culture organism.

Treatment: antitoxin, immune globulin (infants), mechanical ventilation.

Control: proper food preservation, avoid feeding honey to infants.

Mortality: ~5% untreated; <10 cases/year in Australia.

## Typhoid Fever (Salmonella enterica serovar typhi)

Type: Non-diarrhoeal bacterial infection.

Pathogen: Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen.

Transmission: faecal-oral route, contaminated food/water, human carriers.

Epidemiology: 9 million infections, 110,000 deaths/year globally (WHO 2019).

Pathogenesis:

- Adheres via fimbriae, invades M cells (SPI-1 island).
- Survives inside macrophages (Vi capsule antigen protects from complement and
  phagocytosis).
- Disseminates to liver, spleen, gallbladder.

Symptoms: fever, rose spot rash, abdominal pain, headache.

Complications: intestinal hemorrhage, sepsis, chronic carrier state.

Diagnosis: stool or blood culture, PCR, serological tests.

Treatment: antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin); monitor for
multidrug resistance.

Control: sanitation, hand hygiene, vaccination (oral or injectable).

# Structure and Function of the Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract — Healthy vs Diseased States

## Structure and Function (Healthy State)

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small
intestine, large intestine, and associated organs (liver, pancreas, gallbladder).

Its main roles:

- Digestion – mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of food.
- Absorption – uptake of nutrients, water, and electrolytes.
- Barrier and immune function – mucosa and microbiota defend against pathogens.
- Motility – coordinated muscle contractions move contents along the tract.

## Diseased States

Diseases may affect structure, function, or both, through:

- Infection (bacteria, viruses, or protists)
- Inflammation (gastroenteritis, dysentery)
- Intoxication (preformed toxins in food)

Symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, fever, abdominal cramps, and
dehydration.

Non-diarrhoeal diseases (e.g., Polio) may cause extra-intestinal symptoms like
paralysis.

Diarrhoeal diseases (e.g., Giardiasis, Amoebic dysentery) primarily affect the
intestines.

# Diversity of the Normal Microbiota of the GI System

The GI tract harbours trillions of microorganisms — bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi,
and protists.

Normal microbiota is diverse and location-specific:

- Stomach: low pH, few microbes (e.g., Helicobacter pylori in small numbers).
- Small intestine: more microbes, including Lactobacillus and Enterococcus.
- Large intestine: densest microbial community (~10¹¹ cells/g), dominated by
  Bacteroides, Clostridium, Escherichia coli.

These microbes vary between individuals due to diet, genetics, and environment.

# Role of Normal Microbiota in Protecting Against Infection

Normal microbiota protect the host through:

- Colonisation resistance: compete with pathogens for nutrients and attachment sites.
- Production of antimicrobial compounds (e.g., bacteriocins, short-chain fatty acids).
- Immune modulation: stimulate mucosal immunity and maintain gut barrier integrity.
- Metabolic roles: ferment undigested carbohydrates, synthesize vitamins (B, K).

Disturbances (e.g., antibiotics, poor diet) can reduce protective microbes → dysbiosis,
increasing susceptibility to infection.

# Epidemiology, Transmission, Pathology, Virulence, Host Response, Diagnosis, Treatment & Control

## Bacterial Infections

##### Salmonella gastroenteritis

Transmission: contaminated food (raw meat, eggs, poultry, vegetables, chocolate).

Epidemiology: ~13,000 Australian cases/year; 94 million globally; 155,000 deaths.

Pathogenesis: survives stomach acid → attaches via Type III secretion system → invades ileum/colon → acute inflammation.

Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever.

Treatment: rehydration (self-limiting).

Control: hand hygiene, avoid faecal contamination of food

##### Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)

Pathogenesis: attaches via fimbriae → secretes heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins → disrupts ion/water flow → watery diarrhoea.

Symptoms: “Traveller’s diarrhoea”.

Treatment: oral rehydration.

Virulence: toxins + adhesion factors.

## Viral Infections

##### Norovirus

Transmission: faecal–oral, aerosols (vomit), fomites; outbreaks in confined settings (schools, aged care, cruise ships).

Pathogenesis: binds to HBGA receptors → infects mucosal cells → blunts villi → inflammation → short-term lesions.

Epidemiology: 685 million cases globally, 50,000 child deaths/year.

Virulence: low infectious dose (10–100 virions), high stability, short immunity.

Symptoms: acute vomiting, watery diarrhoea (24–48 hrs).

Treatment: self-limiting; rehydration.

Control: hygiene, disinfect contaminated surfaces.

##### Rotavirus

Transmission: faecal–oral, low infectious dose.

Pathogenesis: infects enterocytes in small intestine → NSP4 toxin disrupts chloride transport → water loss + increased motility.

Impact: ~200,000 child deaths yearly (mainly low-income countries).

Treatment: rehydration.

Prevention: live attenuated oral vaccine for infants (<6 months).

Effect: reduced deaths by 60% globally.

## Protist Infections

##### Entamoeba histolytica (Amoebic Dysentery)

Transmission: ingestion of cysts in contaminated food/water.

Pathogenesis: excysts in small intestine → trophozoites invade large intestine mucosa → ulcers and bleeding → cysts excreted in stool.

Symptoms: abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea; 90% asymptomatic.

Complications: liver abscesses via blood spread.

Diagnosis: microscopy or PCR.

Treatment: metronidazole; sanitation/hygiene to prevent spread.

##### Giardia intestinalis (Giardiasis)

Transmission: faecal–oral, waterborne.

Pathogenesis: cysts excyst in stomach → trophozoites attach to small intestine using suction disc → malabsorption of fats/fluid → cysts excreted.

Symptoms: greasy diarrhoea, bloating, cramps, chronic infection → malnutrition.

Diagnosis: stool exam, antigen/PCR tests.

Treatment: metronidazole; sanitation and filtered water.

Control: resistant to chlorine; filtration effective.

# Summary of Transmission and Control

Common route: faecal–oral, via contaminated food/water.

Prevention:

- Hand washing, sanitation, clean water supply.
- Vaccination (Polio, Rotavirus).
- Proper food handling and cooking.
- Public health surveillance and hygiene education.

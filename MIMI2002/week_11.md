# Structure and Function of the Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract — Healthy vs Diseased States

## Structure and Function (Healthy State)

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small
intestine, large intestine, and associated organs (liver, pancreas, gallbladder).

Its main roles:

- Digestion – mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of food.
- Absorption – uptake of nutrients, water, and electrolytes.
- Barrier and immune function – mucosa and microbiota defend against pathogens.
- Motility – coordinated muscle contractions move contents along the tract.

## Diseased States

Diseases may affect structure, function, or both, through:

- Infection (bacteria, viruses, or protists)
- Inflammation (gastroenteritis, dysentery)
- Intoxication (preformed toxins in food)

Symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, fever, abdominal cramps, and
dehydration.

Non-diarrhoeal diseases (e.g., Polio) may cause extra-intestinal symptoms like
paralysis.

Diarrhoeal diseases (e.g., Giardiasis, Amoebic dysentery) primarily affect the
intestines.

# Diversity of the Normal Microbiota of the GI System

The GI tract harbours trillions of microorganisms — bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi,
and protists.

Normal microbiota is diverse and location-specific:

- Stomach: low pH, few microbes (e.g., Helicobacter pylori in small numbers).
- Small intestine: more microbes, including Lactobacillus and Enterococcus.
- Large intestine: densest microbial community (~10¹¹ cells/g), dominated by
  Bacteroides, Clostridium, Escherichia coli.

These microbes vary between individuals due to diet, genetics, and environment.

# Role of Normal Microbiota in Protecting Against Infection

Normal microbiota protect the host through:

- Colonisation resistance: compete with pathogens for nutrients and attachment sites.
- Production of antimicrobial compounds (e.g., bacteriocins, short-chain fatty acids).
- Immune modulation: stimulate mucosal immunity and maintain gut barrier integrity.
- Metabolic roles: ferment undigested carbohydrates, synthesize vitamins (B, K).

Disturbances (e.g., antibiotics, poor diet) can reduce protective microbes → dysbiosis,
increasing susceptibility to infection.

# Epidemiology, Transmission, Pathology, Virulence, Host Response, Diagnosis, Treatment & Control

## Bacterial Infections

##### Salmonella gastroenteritis

Transmission: contaminated food (raw meat, eggs, poultry, vegetables, chocolate).

Epidemiology: ~13,000 Australian cases/year; 94 million globally; 155,000 deaths.

Pathogenesis: survives stomach acid → attaches via Type III secretion system → invades ileum/colon → acute inflammation.

Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever.

Treatment: rehydration (self-limiting).

Control: hand hygiene, avoid faecal contamination of food

##### Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)

Pathogenesis: attaches via fimbriae → secretes heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins → disrupts ion/water flow → watery diarrhoea.

Symptoms: “Traveller’s diarrhoea”.

Treatment: oral rehydration.

Virulence: toxins + adhesion factors.

## Viral Infections

##### Norovirus

Transmission: faecal–oral, aerosols (vomit), fomites; outbreaks in confined settings (schools, aged care, cruise ships).

Pathogenesis: binds to HBGA receptors → infects mucosal cells → blunts villi → inflammation → short-term lesions.

Epidemiology: 685 million cases globally, 50,000 child deaths/year.

Virulence: low infectious dose (10–100 virions), high stability, short immunity.

Symptoms: acute vomiting, watery diarrhoea (24–48 hrs).

Treatment: self-limiting; rehydration.

Control: hygiene, disinfect contaminated surfaces.

##### Rotavirus

Transmission: faecal–oral, low infectious dose.

Pathogenesis: infects enterocytes in small intestine → NSP4 toxin disrupts chloride transport → water loss + increased motility.

Impact: ~200,000 child deaths yearly (mainly low-income countries).

Treatment: rehydration.

Prevention: live attenuated oral vaccine for infants (<6 months).

Effect: reduced deaths by 60% globally.

## Protist Infections

##### Entamoeba histolytica (Amoebic Dysentery)

Transmission: ingestion of cysts in contaminated food/water.

Pathogenesis: excysts in small intestine → trophozoites invade large intestine mucosa → ulcers and bleeding → cysts excreted in stool.

Symptoms: abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea; 90% asymptomatic.

Complications: liver abscesses via blood spread.

Diagnosis: microscopy or PCR.

Treatment: metronidazole; sanitation/hygiene to prevent spread.

##### Giardia intestinalis (Giardiasis)

Transmission: faecal–oral, waterborne.

Pathogenesis: cysts excyst in stomach → trophozoites attach to small intestine using suction disc → malabsorption of fats/fluid → cysts excreted.

Symptoms: greasy diarrhoea, bloating, cramps, chronic infection → malnutrition.

Diagnosis: stool exam, antigen/PCR tests.

Treatment: metronidazole; sanitation and filtered water.

Control: resistant to chlorine; filtration effective.

# Summary of Transmission and Control

Common route: faecal–oral, via contaminated food/water.

Prevention:

- Hand washing, sanitation, clean water supply.
- Vaccination (Polio, Rotavirus).
- Proper food handling and cooking.
- Public health surveillance and hygiene education.

# Principles of Vaccination

Vaccination (or immunisation) aims to induce specific immunity against infectious
diseases while avoiding illness or side effects.

Main principles:

- Stimulate protective immune response without causing disease.
- Mimic natural infection to trigger adaptive immunity (T and B cell activation).
- Prevent infection and disease spread through herd immunity — protecting even those
  not vaccinated.
- Eradicate diseases when humans are the only natural hosts (e.g., smallpox).

Can be achieved by:

- Active immunisation (body produces its own antibodies and memory cells).
- Passive immunisation (ready-made antibodies are provided).

## Criteria for Useful Vaccines

A vaccine must meet several practical and biological standards to be effective on a
population level:

- Safe – minimal side effects or risk of disease.
- Effective – stimulates strong immunity and blocks transmission.
- Long-lasting – provides durable immune memory.
- Cheap and available – affordable for global distribution.
- Stable – can be stored and transported easily.
- Easy to administer – suitable for large-scale use (e.g., injections, oral doses).

# Passive vs Active Immunisation

| Feature                 | **Passive Immunisation**                                   | **Active Immunisation**                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**          | Transfer of pre-formed antibodies                          | Stimulation of body’s own immune response |
| **Onset**               | Immediate                                                  | Takes time to develop                     |
| **Duration**            | Short-lived (weeks to months)                              | Long-term (years to lifelong)             |
| **Memory**              | No immunological memory                                    | Develops immunological memory             |
| **Natural Examples**    | Maternal antibodies via placenta or breast milk            | Recovery from infection                   |
| **Artificial Examples** | Injection of antibodies (e.g., anti-venom, immunoglobulin) | Vaccination with antigens                 |
| **Risks**               | Serum sickness if antibodies from another species          | Mild symptoms from live vaccines possible |

###### Quick Summary

Passive immunisation gives immediate but temporary protection; active immunisation
gives delayed but long-term protection.

## Types of Vaccines Currently in Use

1. Killed (Inactivated) Vaccines
   - Pathogen killed by heat or chemicals (e.g. formaldehyde).
   - Examples: Salk polio vaccine, cholera, hepatitis A.
   - Advantages: Safe (no reversion to virulent form), stable, suitable for
     immunocompromised individuals.
   - Disadvantages: Weaker immune response; multiple doses and adjuvants often
     required.

2. Live Attenuated Vaccines
   - Contain weakened organisms that replicate briefly in the body.
   - Developed by culturing microbes under unusual conditions until they lose
     virulence.
   - Examples: Sabin polio, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), BCG (tuberculosis).
   - Advantages: Strong, long-lasting immunity; often one dose.
   - Disadvantages: Not for immunocompromised; risk of mutation back to virulent
     form; refrigeration required.

3. Subunit Vaccines (Purified or Recombinant Components)
   - Include only specific parts of the pathogen — usually proteins or
     polysaccharides — that trigger immune response.
   - Toxoid vaccines: inactivated bacterial toxins (e.g. diphtheria, tetanus).
   - Recombinant protein vaccines: lab-produced antigens (e.g. Hepatitis B surface
     antigen).
   - Purified protein vaccines: isolated proteins (e.g. influenza haemagglutinin).
   - Adjuvants are often added to enhance the immune response.

4. Adjuvants
   - Substances that enhance immune responses to antigens:
     - Aluminium salts – form antigen depots and increase uptake.
     - Oil emulsions (Freund’s adjuvant) – create long-lasting antigen release.
     - TLR agonists – mimic pathogen signals to activate innate immunity.

5. Combination Vaccines
   - Mix several antigens for convenience and broader protection.
   - Example: DTPa (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis) – toxoids + subunit antigens.

### Real-World Successes

Smallpox eradicated (1979) due to an effective, stable vaccine with no animal
reservoir.

Polio nearly eradicated; comparison of Salk (inactivated) vs Sabin (live) vaccines
shows trade-offs between safety and strength of immunity.

# Immune Responses to Pathogens in the Skin

The skin acts as a physical and immunological barrier.

Breach in the skin allows pathogen entry. Microbes are recognized by pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) detecting PAMPs like LPS, peptidoglycan, and flagellin.

Keratinocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells (Langerhans and dermal DCs) release
cytokines and chemokines, activating innate and adaptive immune responses.

Mast cells trigger vasodilation, inflammation, and leukocyte recruitment through
histamine, TNF, and prostaglandins.

Neutrophils rapidly migrate to infection sites, phagocytose microbes, and form
NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) for large pathogens.

Macrophages handle phagocytosis, cytokine production, antigen presentation, and wound
repair.

# Process of Inflammation and Resolution

Cardinal signs: redness, heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function.

Initiation:

- Cytokines (IL-1, TNF) increase vascular permeability.
- Complement proteins and antibodies enhance inflammation.
- Neutrophils arrive first, followed by monocytes → macrophages.

Resolution:

- Triggered once the pathogen is cleared.
- Neutrophils undergo apoptosis, and macrophages perform efferocytosis (cleanup of
  dead cells).
- Macrophages shift to an M2 (anti-inflammatory) state, secreting IL-10 and TGF-β.
- Incomplete resolution can lead to chronic inflammation.

# Complement Pathway and MAC Formation

Complement = 30+ proteins that act as sensors of PAMPs and DAMPs.

Three activation pathways:

- Alternative: spontaneous C3 hydrolysis → C3b binds microbes → forms C3 convertase
  (C3bBb).
- Classical: antibody (IgM/IgG) binds pathogen → C1 activation → C4b2a = C3
  convertase.
- Lectin: mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds microbe → C4 and C2 cleavage → C3
  convertase.

All converge at C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 → C5b.

C5b recruits C6–C9, forming the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) → creates pores → cell
lysis.

Host protection: CD59 prevents MAC assembly on self-cells.

# Effector Functions of Antibody Isotypes

| **Isotype** | **Main Functions**                                        | **Features**                                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IgM**     | Activates complement (classical pathway)                  | First antibody made; pentameric; high avidity, low affinity |
| **IgG**     | Opsonization, neutralization, ADCC, complement activation | Most abundant in serum; long half-life; crosses placenta    |
| **IgA**     | Neutralization at mucosal surfaces                        | Found in mucosal secretions (saliva, tears, breast milk)    |
| **IgE**     | Binds FcεR on mast cells and basophils → degranulation    | Defense against parasites; allergic reactions               |
| **IgD**     | B cell receptor on naïve B cells                          | Role in B cell activation                                   |

# Functions of Fcγ Receptors (FcγRs)

Fcγ receptors bind the Fc region of IgG, linking antibodies to effector cells.

Main functions:

- Phagocytosis of opsonized microbes.
- Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) by NK cells.
- Cytokine release by macrophages.

FcγRI (CD64) – high affinity; found on macrophages, neutrophils.

FcγRII and FcγRIII – lower affinity; mediate immune complex clearance and ADCC.

# Combating Extracellular Bacterial Infections

## Complement System

Opsonization (C3b) → enhances phagocytosis.

C5a → recruits neutrophils and triggers inflammation.

MAC → lyses Gram-negative bacteria

## Phagocytes

Neutrophils: rapid response; engulf microbes and release NETs.

Macrophages: longer-lived; secrete cytokines and present antigen to T cells.

## Antibodies

IgM and IgG neutralize toxins, opsonize bacteria, and activate complement.

## T Cells (Th17)

Th17 cells release IL-17 and IL-22 → recruit neutrophils, promote epithelial repair,
and induce antimicrobial peptides.

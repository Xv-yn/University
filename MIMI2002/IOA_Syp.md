# Treponema pallidum Infection Strategy

1. Entry & Primary Stage
   - Treponema pallidum enters through a micro-wound in skin/mucosa during sexual
     contact.
   - It multiplies locally and causes a chancre (painless ulcer) at the entry site.
   - Meanwhile, spirochetes disseminate systemically via blood and lymph, even before
     the chancre heals.

2. Secondary Stage
   - A few weeks to months later → bacteria are widespread in the body.
   - Immune system detects them → causes rash, lymphadenopathy, mucous lesions,
     systemic symptoms.
   - Many bacteria are cleared, but not all — some evade through antigenic variation
     - stealth.

3. Latent Stage
   - The infection becomes asymptomatic.
   - The immune system keeps the bacteria suppressed but not eliminated.
   - Bacteria remain hidden in tissues (lymph nodes, CNS, organs).
   - This stage can last years or decades.

4. Tertiary Stage (in some untreated patients)
   - Eventually, a chronic low-level immune battle causes tissue damage.
   - Not due to rapid bacterial growth, but due to immune-mediated scarring and
     inflammation.
   - Results in gummas, cardiovascular syphilis, neurosyphilis.
     - Gummas → rubbery, destructive granulomas in skin, bone, and organs.
     - Cardiovascular syphilis → scarring of blood vessels, especially the aorta
       → aneurysms.
     - Neurosyphilis → degeneration in spinal cord/brain → paralysis, dementia,
       sensory loss.

## Immune Evasion

1. “Invisible” Outer Membrane
   - Very few proteins are exposed on the bacterial surface.
   - Compared to most Gram-negative bacteria, its outer membrane is almost
     antigen-poor.
   - This makes it hard for antibodies to detect and bind.

2. Antigenic Variation
   - The TprK protein (a surface antigen) constantly changes its variable regions
     through gene conversion.
   - Antibodies made against one version quickly become obsolete.
   - It’s the same principle as gonorrhoea’s pili/Opa variation → constant disguise.

3. Slow Growth
   - Doubling time is ~30–33 hours (very slow).
   - Fewer bacterial products are released at once, so there’s less “danger signal”
     to alert the immune system.

4. Host Protein Camouflage
   - T. pallidum can bind host fibronectin to its surface.
   - This makes it look like part of the body’s own connective tissue.

5. Immune Privilege Niches
   - The spirochetes can hide in areas with reduced immune surveillance (CNS, eye,
     placenta).
   - These niches allow long-term persistence (latency).

# Immune Response to Treponema pallidum

## Innate Immune Response (First Responders)

1. Detection
   - Macrophages and dendritic cells recognize T. pallidum components via TLRs (esp.
     TLR2).
   - This triggers release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6).

2. Neutrophils and Macrophages
   - Neutrophils can arrive, but spirochetes resist killing thanks to stealthy
     membranes and fibronectin coating.
   - Macrophages ingest some spirochetes, especially if opsonized with antibodies,
     but clearance is incomplete.

3. Complement
   - T. pallidum is somewhat susceptible to complement, but fibronectin coating and
     low surface antigens limit effectiveness.

## Adaptive Immune Response (Specific Defenders)

1. Humoral (B-cell/Antibody)
   - Antibodies form against TprK and other proteins.
   - These can opsonize bacteria, helping macrophages clear them.
   - BUT:
     - Antigenic variation (TprK) constantly makes old antibodies useless.
     - Antibodies reduce bacterial load but don’t eradicate infection.

2. Cell-Mediated (T-cell)
   - Th1 response develops → IFN-γ activates macrophages.
   - This is important for controlling bacterial numbers.
   - CD8+ T cells may contribute by killing infected host cells.

3. Why it fails long-term
   - Antigenic variation outpaces antibody effectiveness.
   - Few surface antigens = weak activation of B cells.
   - Spirochetes hide in immune-privileged sites (CNS, eye, placenta).
   - Result: bacteria survive at low levels → latency and possible tertiary disease.

# Respiratory Diseases

## Streptococcus pneumoniae

Pathogenesis

1. Colonizes nasopharynx using adhesins + IgA protease.
2. Capsule prevents phagocytosis, allowing spread to lungs or bloodstream.
3. Pneumolysin damages epithelial cells → inflammation + fluid leakage.
4. Lung alveoli fill with exudate → lobar consolidation.

Virulence mechanism:

- Polysaccharide capsule → prevents phagocytosis
- Pneumolysin → damages respiratory epithelium + activates complement
- IgA protease → helps colonize mucosa

Causes symptoms:

- Lobar pneumonia: fever, productive cough, rusty sputum
- Otitis media / sinusitis: due to mucosal invasion
- Meningitis: capsule helps it enter bloodstream → CNS

## Streptococcus pyogenes

Pathogenesis:

1. Adheres to skin/throat using M protein.
2. Evades immunity (M protein + hyaluronic acid capsule).
3. Streptolysins destroy WBCs → inflammation + tissue damage.
4. Enzymes (hyaluronidase) allow rapid tissue spread.
5. Spe toxins cause superantigen effects (cytokine storm).

Virulence mechanism:

- M protein → immune evasion → pharyngitis, skin infection
- Streptolysin O/S → cell lysis → tissue damage
- SpeA/SpeC superantigens → massive cytokine release
- Hyaluronidase → spreads through tissue

Causes symptoms:

- Pharyngitis (“strep throat”): sore throat, fever
- Scarlet fever: strawberry tongue, sandpaper rash (Spe toxins)
- Necrotizing fasciitis: severe pain + rapid tissue necrosis
- Impetigo: honey-crust lesions

## Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Pathogenesis:

1. Inhaled droplets enter alveoli.
2. Bacteria are phagocytosed but survive due to mycolic acids + blocked
   phagosome–lysosome fusion.
3. Granulomas form to contain infection.
4. Caseous necrosis develops in granulomas.
5. Reactivation may occur if immunity weakens.

Virulence mechanism:

- Mycolic acid cell wall → resists digestion by macrophages
- Cord factor (trehalose dimycolate) → inhibits phagosome-lysosome fusion
- Granuloma formation → chronic inflammation, caseous necrosis

Causes symptoms:

- Chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, hemoptysis
- Granulomas cause cavitary lesions in lungs
- Dissemination → miliary TB

## Aspergillus fumigatus

Pathogenesis:

1. Spores inhaled into alveoli.
2. In healthy people: spores cleared → no disease.
3. In asthma/CF: immune reaction → ABPA (allergic inflammation).
4. In damaged lungs: fungus grows into cavities → aspergilloma.
5. In immunocompromised: hyphae invade blood vessels → necrosis + dissemination.

Virulence mechanism:

- Airborne spores → small enough to reach alveoli
- Gliotoxin → impairs macrophages & neutrophils
- Hyphal invasion → angioinvasion (blood vessel invasion)

Causes symptoms:

- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) → wheezing, asthma-like
- Aspergilloma → fungal ball → hemoptysis
- Invasive aspergillosis → fever, chest pain, necrotic nodules (esp.
  immunocompromised)

## Influenza virus

Pathogenesis:

1. Virus binds respiratory epithelium via hemagglutinin.
2. Replicates inside cells, killing them.
3. Loss of mucociliary function → impaired clearance.
4. Immune response releases cytokines → fever, aches.
5. Dead epithelium → risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Virulence mechanism:

- Hemagglutinin (HA) → binds respiratory epithelium
- Neuraminidase (NA) → viral release + mucus penetration
- Antigenic drift/shift → evades immune system
- Cytolysis of respiratory cells → secondary bacterial infections

Causes symptoms:

- High fever, myalgia, headache (due to cytokine response)
- Dry cough from epithelial destruction
- Pneumonia (viral or superimposed bacterial)

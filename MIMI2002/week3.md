# Infectious Disease Chain

## Causative Agents of Disease

- Biological Agents
  - Bacteria
    e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis → Tuberculosis
    Cause disease by producing toxins, damaging tissues, or triggering immune
    overreactions.
  - Viruses
    e.g., SARS-CoV-2 → COVID-19
    Not truly “alive”; require host cells to replicate.

  - Fungi
    e.g., Candida albicans → Candidiasis
    Opportunistic infections, often in immunocompromised hosts.

  - Protozoa
    e.g., Plasmodium falciparum → Malaria
    Single-celled eukaryotes, often with complex life cycles.

  - Helminths (parasitic worms)
    e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides → Ascariasis
    Multicellular parasites that consume nutrients and damage tissues.

  - Prions
    e.g., Prion protein → Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
    Infectious misfolded proteins, no nucleic acid.

- Non-Biological (Non-Living) Agents
  - Chemical agents
    Toxins (e.g., aflatoxins from fungi, botulinum toxin from bacteria).
    Environmental pollutants or drugs at toxic levels.

  - Physical agents
    Radiation, extreme heat/cold, mechanical trauma.

  - Nutritional deficiencies/excesses
    e.g., Lack of vitamin C → Scurvy.

  - Genetic factors (not infectious, but causative of disease states).

- Limitations of Koch’s Postulates
  - Some microbes cannot be grown in pure culture (e.g., viruses).
  - Some diseases don’t have an animal model.
  - Some microbes cause disease only in certain conditions → host variability.
  - Asymptomatic carriers exist (pathogen present but no disease).
  - Co-infections complicate causation.
  - Sometimes by the time symptoms appear, the causative agent is gone.

## Infection Disease Chain Principle

The chain of infection has six links. Think of it as a circle where each link
connects to the next:

```
Infectious agent <------+
    |                   |
    v                   |
Reservoir               |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Portal of exit          |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Mode of transmission    |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Portal of entry         |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Host susceptibility ----+
```

- Infectious agent
  - The microbe that causes disease (bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, prion).
- Reservoir
  - The natural home where the agent lives and multiplies (humans, animals, environment, food, water).
- Portal of exit
  - The way the agent leaves the reservoir (respiratory droplets, feces, blood, urine, skin).
- Mode of transmission
  - How the agent travels to a new host (direct contact, airborne, vector-borne, food/water).
- Portal of entry
  - How the agent gets into the next host (mouth, nose, skin breaks, urogenital tract).
- Host susceptibility
  - Whether the new host can become infected (depends on immunity, age, health, vaccination, genetics, nutrition).

### Reservoirs

This is where pathogens live and multiply

Think of a reservoir as the “home base” or storage unit for infectious agents. This is
where they hang out, multiply, and wait until they can move to a new host.

Types of reservoirs:

- Inanimate objects
  - Examples: food, water, soil, surfaces.
- Contagious humans (symptomatic)
  - People who are sick with active disease.
  - Examples: coughing, sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea.
- Animals (zoonoses)
  - Diseases that jump from animals → humans.
  - Examples: cow with TB in milk, rabies via bite, influenza from birds.
- Human carriers (asymptomatic)
  - People who don’t look sick but still carry and spread germs.

### Portal of Entry -> Transmission -> Portal of Exit

Using the disease Vibrio cholerae as an example:

**Portal of Entry**: Mouth → ingestion of contaminated water or food.

**Mode of Transmission**: Fecal-oral route (sewage-contaminated water/food).

**Portal of Exit**: Stool (massive watery diarrhea spreads the bacteria back into the
environment).

### Transmission

- Direct Transmission
  - Contact
    - Skin-to-skin: handshakes (Staphylococci), kissing (strep throat)
    - Sexual contact: STIs – Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis, HIV, HSV, Trichomoniasis
  - Air-borne
    - Aerosols (coughing, talking, sneezing)
    - Examples: influenza, chickenpox, mumps, measles
  - Mother → Baby (in utero)
    - Vertical transmission
    - Examples: Zika virus (microcephaly), HIV (AIDS)
  - Trauma
    - Through skin breaks: tattoos, burns, bites, injuries
    - Examples: polymicrobial infections, Staphylococci

- Indirect Transmission
  - Vehicles
    - Contaminated food/water
    - Examples: cholera, food poisoning (Salmonella, Listeria)
  - Fomites (objects)
    - Dry: dust/linen (hospital infections → Staphylococci)
    - Wet: contaminated surfaces (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
  - Vectors (insects/animals)
    - Mosquito: malaria
    - Tsetse fly: trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)
    - Flea: plague

### How the links interrelate to increase disease incidence

Each link feeds into the next.

Example:

A person with TB (agent) coughs (exit) → droplets spread (transmission) → inhaled by
another person (entry) → if the new host has weak immunity (susceptibility), they
develop disease.

If all six links are intact, the chain keeps repeating → incidence of disease rises,
sometimes explosively (epidemics).

### Breaking the chain to control epidemics

If you break any single link, the chain collapses and infection can’t spread.

**Agent**: kill microbes (antibiotics, antivirals, disinfectants).

**Reservoir**: isolate patients, control animals, clean environment.

**Exit**: cover coughs, use masks, wound dressings.

**Transmission**: handwashing, safe sex, vector control (mosquito nets), clean water.

**Entry**: protective equipment, vaccines, barrier methods (condoms, gloves).

**Susceptible host**: boost immunity with vaccines, improve nutrition, treat underlying
disease.

# Epidemiology

## Comparing terms in Epidemiology (occurrence of disease)

**Sporadic disease**: occurs occasionally and irregularly
Example: Salmonella food poisoning

**Outbreak**: sudden local increase in cases above expected
Example: Hendra virus in QLD, Ebola in Congo

**Endemic disease**: constantly present in a population, usually at low frequency
Example: Common cold, TB, malaria

**Epidemic**: sudden rise in disease cases in a population or region
Example: seasonal influenza

**Pandemic**: epidemic that spreads globally across countries/continents
Example: COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)

Visual difference (maps):

Endemic = low scattered dots (steady presence)

Epidemic = cluster of dots (sudden local rise)

Pandemic = dots everywhere across the globe (widespread)

## How epidemiologists recognise epidemics

- Monitor public health data: incidence and prevalence
- Compare observed vs expected cases
- If actual numbers greatly exceed expected baseline → epidemic is suspected

Key metrics:

- Incidence = number of new cases / population at risk
- Attack rate = proportion of population that becomes ill during outbreak
- Prevalence = total ongoing cases

Analogy: Like watching water in a bathtub:

- Incidence = tap dripping water in
- Prevalence = total water level
- Recovery & death = water leaving the tub

## How spread of disease can be controlled

Control = breaking links in the chain of infection

Agent: destroy microbes (disinfection, antibiotics, antivirals)

Reservoir: isolate sick patients, animal control, clean environment

Portal of exit: cover coughs, sanitation, masks, safe waste disposal

Mode of transmission: hand hygiene, safe sex, vector control, clean water

Portal of entry: PPE, vaccines, insect repellents, condoms

Susceptible host: vaccination, improve nutrition, treat underlying illness

Goals of epidemiology (from first slide):

Control transmission / speed of spread

Eliminate pathogen from population

# Infectious Disease Chain

## Causative Agents of Disease

- Biological Agents
  - Bacteria
    e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis → Tuberculosis
    Cause disease by producing toxins, damaging tissues, or triggering immune
    overreactions.
  - Viruses
    e.g., SARS-CoV-2 → COVID-19
    Not truly “alive”; require host cells to replicate.

  - Fungi
    e.g., Candida albicans → Candidiasis
    Opportunistic infections, often in immunocompromised hosts.

  - Protozoa
    e.g., Plasmodium falciparum → Malaria
    Single-celled eukaryotes, often with complex life cycles.

  - Helminths (parasitic worms)
    e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides → Ascariasis
    Multicellular parasites that consume nutrients and damage tissues.

  - Prions
    e.g., Prion protein → Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
    Infectious misfolded proteins, no nucleic acid.

- Non-Biological (Non-Living) Agents
  - Chemical agents
    Toxins (e.g., aflatoxins from fungi, botulinum toxin from bacteria).
    Environmental pollutants or drugs at toxic levels.

  - Physical agents
    Radiation, extreme heat/cold, mechanical trauma.

  - Nutritional deficiencies/excesses
    e.g., Lack of vitamin C → Scurvy.

  - Genetic factors (not infectious, but causative of disease states).

- Limitations of Koch’s Postulates
  - Some microbes cannot be grown in pure culture (e.g., viruses).
  - Some diseases don’t have an animal model.
  - Some microbes cause disease only in certain conditions → host variability.
  - Asymptomatic carriers exist (pathogen present but no disease).
  - Co-infections complicate causation.
  - Sometimes by the time symptoms appear, the causative agent is gone.

## Infection Disease Chain Principle

The chain of infection has six links. Think of it as a circle where each link
connects to the next:

```
Infectious agent <------+
    |                   |
    v                   |
Reservoir               |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Portal of exit          |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Mode of transmission    |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Portal of entry         |
    |                   |
    v                   |
Host susceptibility ----+
```

- Infectious agent
  - The microbe that causes disease (bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite, prion).
- Reservoir
  - The natural home where the agent lives and multiplies (humans, animals, environment, food, water).
- Portal of exit
  - The way the agent leaves the reservoir (respiratory droplets, feces, blood, urine, skin).
- Mode of transmission
  - How the agent travels to a new host (direct contact, airborne, vector-borne, food/water).
- Portal of entry
  - How the agent gets into the next host (mouth, nose, skin breaks, urogenital tract).
- Host susceptibility
  - Whether the new host can become infected (depends on immunity, age, health, vaccination, genetics, nutrition).

### Reservoirs

This is where pathogens live and multiply

Think of a reservoir as the “home base” or storage unit for infectious agents. This is
where they hang out, multiply, and wait until they can move to a new host.

Types of reservoirs:

- Inanimate objects
  - Examples: food, water, soil, surfaces.
- Contagious humans (symptomatic)
  - People who are sick with active disease.
  - Examples: coughing, sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea.
- Animals (zoonoses)
  - Diseases that jump from animals → humans.
  - Examples: cow with TB in milk, rabies via bite, influenza from birds.
- Human carriers (asymptomatic)
  - People who don’t look sick but still carry and spread germs.

### Portal of Entry -> Transmission -> Portal of Exit

Using the disease Vibrio cholerae as an example:

**Portal of Entry**: Mouth → ingestion of contaminated water or food.

**Mode of Transmission**: Fecal-oral route (sewage-contaminated water/food).

**Portal of Exit**: Stool (massive watery diarrhea spreads the bacteria back into the
environment).

### Transmission

- Direct Transmission
  - Contact
    - Skin-to-skin: handshakes (Staphylococci), kissing (strep throat)
    - Sexual contact: STIs – Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis, HIV, HSV, Trichomoniasis
  - Air-borne
    - Aerosols (coughing, talking, sneezing)
    - Examples: influenza, chickenpox, mumps, measles
  - Mother → Baby (in utero)
    - Vertical transmission
    - Examples: Zika virus (microcephaly), HIV (AIDS)
  - Trauma
    - Through skin breaks: tattoos, burns, bites, injuries
    - Examples: polymicrobial infections, Staphylococci

- Indirect Transmission
  - Vehicles
    - Contaminated food/water
    - Examples: cholera, food poisoning (Salmonella, Listeria)
  - Fomites (objects)
    - Dry: dust/linen (hospital infections → Staphylococci)
    - Wet: contaminated surfaces (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
  - Vectors (insects/animals)
    - Mosquito: malaria
    - Tsetse fly: trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)
    - Flea: plague

### How the links interrelate to increase disease incidence

Each link feeds into the next.

Example:

A person with TB (agent) coughs (exit) → droplets spread (transmission) → inhaled by
another person (entry) → if the new host has weak immunity (susceptibility), they
develop disease.

If all six links are intact, the chain keeps repeating → incidence of disease rises,
sometimes explosively (epidemics).

### Breaking the chain to control epidemics

If you break any single link, the chain collapses and infection can’t spread.

**Agent**: kill microbes (antibiotics, antivirals, disinfectants).

**Reservoir**: isolate patients, control animals, clean environment.

**Exit**: cover coughs, use masks, wound dressings.

**Transmission**: handwashing, safe sex, vector control (mosquito nets), clean water.

**Entry**: protective equipment, vaccines, barrier methods (condoms, gloves).

**Susceptible host**: boost immunity with vaccines, improve nutrition, treat underlying
disease.

# Epidemiology

## Comparing terms in Epidemiology (occurrence of disease)

**Sporadic disease**: occurs occasionally and irregularly
Example: Salmonella food poisoning

**Outbreak**: sudden local increase in cases above expected
Example: Hendra virus in QLD, Ebola in Congo

**Endemic disease**: constantly present in a population, usually at low frequency
Example: Common cold, TB, malaria

**Epidemic**: sudden rise in disease cases in a population or region
Example: seasonal influenza

**Pandemic**: epidemic that spreads globally across countries/continents
Example: COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)

Visual difference (maps):

Endemic = low scattered dots (steady presence)

Epidemic = cluster of dots (sudden local rise)

Pandemic = dots everywhere across the globe (widespread)

## How epidemiologists recognise epidemics

- Monitor public health data: incidence and prevalence
- Compare observed vs expected cases
- If actual numbers greatly exceed expected baseline → epidemic is suspected

Key metrics:

- Incidence = number of new cases / population at risk
- Attack rate = proportion of population that becomes ill during outbreak
- Prevalence = total ongoing cases

Analogy: Like watching water in a bathtub:

- Incidence = tap dripping water in
- Prevalence = total water level
- Recovery & death = water leaving the tub

## How spread of disease can be controlled

Control = breaking links in the chain of infection

Agent: destroy microbes (disinfection, antibiotics, antivirals)

Reservoir: isolate sick patients, animal control, clean environment

Portal of exit: cover coughs, sanitation, masks, safe waste disposal

Mode of transmission: hand hygiene, safe sex, vector control, clean water

Portal of entry: PPE, vaccines, insect repellents, condoms

Susceptible host: vaccination, improve nutrition, treat underlying illness

Goals of epidemiology (from first slide):

Control transmission / speed of spread

Eliminate pathogen from population

# Shift to Parasitism in the Symbiosis Spectrum

1. Symbiosis Spectrum Dynamics
   - Symbiotic relationships are not fixed — they can shift dynamically between
     mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.
   - The host’s health status and environmental conditions strongly influence the
     direction of this shift.

2. Factors Causing a Shift to Parasitism
   - Host Susceptibility
     - Weakened or immunocompromised host → microbes that were harmless or even
       beneficial can exploit vulnerability.
     - Example: gut microbiota imbalance during illness, stress, or immune
       suppression.
   - Infectious Agent Characteristics
     - Microbes may carry virulence factors that remain dormant in normal
       conditions but activate under stress.
     - Horizontal gene transfer can introduce pathogenic traits.
   - Microbiota Imbalance (Dysbiosis)
     - Normal microbiota maintains immune homeostasis.
     - Disturbance (e.g., antibiotics, poor diet, stress) shifts the microbial
       composition, allowing opportunistic pathogens to dominate.
   - Environmental & Lifestyle Factors
     - Diet (e.g., high fat/sugar altering Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio).
     - Travel or exposure to new microbes.
     - Stress, smoking, alcohol, etc.

# Distinguishing Commensals from Pathogens

1. Commensals
   - Part of the normal microbiota.
   - Typically cause no harm to the host; may even provide benefits like colonisation
     resistance against pathogens.
   - Example: Staphylococcus aureus
     - Commensal in 20–40% of healthy people (commonly in the nose).
     - Normally harmless unless host defenses are compromised.
     - Can shift to cause disease in susceptible individuals (boils, impetigo,
       scalded skin syndrome, bloodstream infections).
   - Key idea → harmless in one context, harmful in another.

2. Pathogens
   - Organisms that always cause disease when present in a susceptible host.
   - Usually acquired exogenously (from outside).
   - Example: Variola virus (smallpox)
     - Always pathogenic → never a commensal state.
     - Causes severe systemic disease.
     - Eradicated through vaccination, quarantine, and absence of animal reservoir.

> [!note] Note
> Clear distinction: pathogenicity is inherent and not dependent on host microbiota
> context.

# Mutualism vs. Commensalism

1. Mutualism (Win–Win)
   - Both organisms benefit from the relationship.
   - The host and the microbe each gain something positive.

2. Commensalism (Win–Neutral)
   - One organism benefits, the other is unaffected (neither harmed nor helped).
   - The host does not gain an obvious advantage, but also doesn’t suffer.

# How Link to Disease Chain Interrelate to Increase the Incidence and Spread of Disease

1. Host–Microbe Interaction
   - Infection is a dynamic battle between pathogen and host.
   - Host mounts an immune response (e.g., antibodies) → temporarily reduces pathogen
     numbers.
   - Some pathogens adapt using antigenic variation (changing coat proteins) → allows
     evasion of immunity.
   - Result: repeated cycles of growth and decline, keeping pathogen load high.
   - Link to disease chain:
     - Agent: antigenic variation increases persistence.
     - Host: immune evasion prolongs infection.
     - Transmission: sustained pathogen levels increase spread.

2. Microbial Virulence
   - Definition: intensity of pathogenicity; higher virulence = higher harm.
   - Indicators:
     - Ability to invade tissues.
     - Ability to evade immunity.
     - Fatality rates.
   - Link to disease chain:
     - Determines how efficiently the agent establishes infection and spreads.
     - More virulent pathogens = higher incidence, faster outbreaks.

3. Virulence Factors (mechanisms aiding spread)
   - Aid colonisation: e.g., capsules, pili/fimbriae, outer membrane proteins.
   - Penetration of host tissues: e.g., invasins.
   - Evasion of host response: e.g., encapsulation, immune suppression, antigenic
     variation.
   - Direct damage: toxins (exotoxins, endotoxins), degradative enzymes.
   - Antibiotic resistance: prolongs infection and transmission.
   - Link to disease chain:
     - These traits explain how microbes overcome barriers in the chain of infection
       (entry, survival, multiplication, exit, spread).

# Breaking the Chain of Infection

1. Colonisation (Attachment/Adhesion)
   - Microbes must first attach to host cells via:
     - Non-specific: biofilms, glycocalyx.
     - Specific: adhesins on fimbriae/pili, viral spike proteins binding host
       receptors.
   - Breaking this link:
     - Vaccines or receptor blockers can prevent adhesion.
     - Example: neutralising antibodies binding viral spikes → block host cell entry.

2. Immune Evasion (Host Cell Uptake)
   - Pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes use invasins/internalins to trigger
     endocytosis and hide inside host cells.
   - Can move using actin tails → spread cell to cell.
   - Breaking this link:
     - Strong immune response or antimicrobial therapy to stop intracellular
       replication.
     - Prevents pathogen persistence and further spread.

3. Penetrating Host Tissues
   - Enzymes allow pathogens to invade deeper tissues:
     - Hyaluronidase → breaks down connective tissue “cement.”
     - Collagenase → digests collagen for spread.
     - Hemolysins → break RBCs, release iron, weaken host defense.
   - Breaking this link:
     - Use of inhibitors, targeted antimicrobials, or vaccines against virulence
       factors.
     - Stops systemic spread, containing infection locally.

4. Evading Host Defenses
   - Capsules, phagocytosis resistance, and immune evasion mechanisms prolong
     infection.
   - Breaking this link:
     - Vaccination against capsule antigens (e.g., pneumococcal vaccine).
     - Enhances immune clearance → stops transmission cycle.

# Microbial Strategies

1. Colonisation
   - Adhesion/Attachment is the first step in establishing infection.
     - Non-specific adhesion: biofilms, glycocalyces.
     - Specific adhesion: adhesins/ligands bind to host receptors.
       - Example: Fimbriae (pili) in bacteria, spike proteins in viruses.
   - These strategies ensure microbes remain at infection sites despite host
     clearance mechanisms.

2. Invasion
   - Microbes penetrate host tissues or cells using enzymes and invasins.
   - Examples:
     - Listeria monocytogenes: invasin proteins trigger endocytosis in
       non-phagocytic cells; uses actin tails for intracellular movement.
     - Enzymes:
       - Hyaluronidase → breaks down hyaluronic acid (cellular cement) → spreads
         faster.
       - Collagenase → breaks down collagen → nutrients & rapid spread.
       - Hemolysins → lyse RBCs for iron, weaken immune function.

3. Immune Evasion
   - Microbes use diverse strategies to avoid or resist host defenses:
     - Capsules (polysaccharides): mask antigenic sites, prevent phagocytosis (e.g.
       Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis).
     - IgA protease: degrades IgA antibodies in mucosal surfaces (e.g. Neisseria,
       Haemophilus).
     - Protein A (Staph aureus): binds Fc of IgG, prevents opsonisation &
       phagocytosis.
     - M protein (Strep pyogenes): prevents phagocytosis, molecular mimicry →
       autoimmune complications (acute rheumatic fever).
     - Affecting phagocytosis: microbes can inhibit chemotaxis, block
       phagosome-lysosome fusion, resist lysosomal enzymes, or survive
       intracellularly.

4. Damage to Host
   - Pathogens cause harm through virulence factors:
     - Toxins:
       - Exotoxins: secreted proteins (e.g. tetanus, cholera); high antigenicity;
         specific effects.
       - Endotoxins (LPS/Lipid A): part of Gram-negative cell wall; released on
         lysis; cause systemic inflammation (fever, shock).
     - Cytotoxins, degradative enzymes, superantigens: disrupt host tissues and
       immune signaling.
     - Pathogenicity islands (PI): clusters of genes encoding virulence factors
       (e.g. secretion systems, toxins, resistance).
     - Damage promotes spread of infection and increases severity.

5. Host Susceptibility
   - Infection outcome depends on host factors:
     - Age, sex, socio-economic status, genetics.
     - Non-specific barriers: skin, stomach acid, microbiota, mucus, enzymes.
     - Immune status: immunocompromised hosts more vulnerable.
   - Interaction between microbial virulence and host defenses determines whether
     colonisation progresses to disease.

# Role of the Host Immune System in Responding to Infection

1. Host Susceptibility
   - Susceptibility determines how strongly the immune system can resist infection.
   - Factors influencing susceptibility:
     - Host factors: age, sex, occupation, socio-economic status, genetics/inherited
       traits.
     - Non-specific defences: intact skin, mucous membranes, stomach acid, saliva,
       tears (lysozyme), cilia, microbiota, sweat, and urination/defecation.
     - Immune status: immunocompromised hosts are more vulnerable to infection.

2. Infectious Dose (ID50)
   - The number of microbes required to cause infection in 50% of hosts.
   - Disease outcome depends on:
     - Initial inoculum (how many pathogens enter).
     - Virulence of the microbe.
     - Host susceptibility (immune competence).
   - Examples:
     - Very low infectious dose (<10 cells): Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Shigella,
       Hepatitis B.
     - High infectious dose: Vibrio cholerae (10⁶–10¹¹ cells).
   - Stronger immune systems can resist smaller doses; weaker systems allow easier
     establishment of infection.

3. Limitations of Understanding Host-Pathogen Interaction
   - Research models (e.g. mice or single demographics) may not represent all hosts.
   - Ethical limitations restrict human testing.
   - One Health concept: Human, animal, and environmental health are interconnected.
   - Holobionts: The host and its associated microbiota form an ecological niche that
     shapes immunity and susceptibility.

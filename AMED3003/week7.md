# Western Blotting Biomarker

1. Characteristics of Biomarkers for Diagnostic Use
   - Association with Disease/Physiology
     - A biomarker must be biologically relevant—linked to the disease process or physiological
       state.
     - Example: Telomerase is reactivated in cancer cells (immortal phenotype) but repressed in
       most normal somatic cells.
   - Detectability
     - Biomarker must be measurable with accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.
     - Antibodies are central tools in diagnostics (e.g., immunohistochemistry,
       immunofluorescence), allowing detection of even small amounts of biomarker proteins.
   - Practical Features of a Good Biomarker
     - Abundant enough to be reliably detected (e.g., question of whether ~50–100 telomerase
       molecules per cell is sufficient).
     - Specific to the target condition, minimizing false positives.
     - Stable and accessible in patient samples (e.g., blood, tissue, urine).
     - Ideally predictive of disease progression or treatment response.

2. Difficulties in Translating Biomarker Research
   - Biological Complexity
     - Many biomarkers, like telomerase, show strong experimental promise but face challenges
       in real-world variability and interpretation.
     - Expression in limited normal tissues (ovary/testes) complicates specificity.
   - Sensitivity and Quantification Issues
     - Low abundance (e.g., tens of molecules per cell) makes detection technically difficult.
     - Requires highly sensitive assays, which may not be standardized or widely available.
   - Reproducibility and Validation
     - Biomarkers discovered in lab settings may not replicate across diverse patient
       populations.
     - Need for large, multi-center validation studies.
   - Clinical Utility Gap
     - Even if strongly linked to disease, a biomarker must provide actionable information
       beyond existing diagnostics.
     - Regulatory hurdles, cost, and integration into clinical workflows slow adoption.

3. Evidence-Based Choice of Diagnostic Test
   - Balancing Test Performance
     - Consider sensitivity (detecting true positives) vs specificity (avoiding false
       positives).
     - High sensitivity: good for screening.
     - High specificity: essential for confirming diagnosis.
   - Context of Use
     - The value of a diagnostic depends on prevalence, disease severity, and available
       treatment options.
     - Example: Telomerase might be more useful in cancers lacking better markers.
   - Evidence Hierarchy
     - Strongest evidence comes from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses showing
       improved patient outcomes.
     - Adoption should be based on reproducible data, clinical validation, and demonstration
       that the test changes management decisions.
   - Cost-effectiveness and Accessibility
     - Diagnostics must be affordable and scalable to have real-world impact.

# Unorthodox Pathology

1. Why Do We Do Pathology Tests?
   - Purposes:
     - Diagnose/detect disease (e.g., Troponin I in AMI).
     - Identify risk markers (e.g., cholesterol & CV risk).
     - Monitor disease or relapse (e.g., rising anti-DNA antibodies in lupus).
     - Exclude disease.

2. Quality of Tests
   - Requirements:
     - NATA accreditation for labs in Australia.
     - Quality assurance programs (internal & external controls).
   - Multiple methods: Same analyte can be measured differently (e.g., anti-DNA: ELISA,
     Farr assay, ALBIA).
   - Key criteria:
     - Sensitivity, specificity, and biological plausibility.

3. Why Patients Seek Non-Validated Tests
   - Conventional testing doesn’t provide answers.
   - Marketing persuades patients/doctors.
   - Consumers unaware of lack of clinical utility.

4. Allergies & IgE
   - Allergies = immune sensitisation → mast cell mediator release.
   - Types: Aeroallergens (rhinitis, asthma), foods, drugs, venoms (anaphylaxis).
   - Anaphylaxis: hives, swelling, wheeze, hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Hygiene hypothesis: Reduced microbial exposure contributes to rising allergy rates.
   - Structure & Role of IgE
     - Evolved to fight parasites (helminths).
     - Less useful in modern Western environments.
   - Receptors:
     - FcεRI (high affinity) – mast cells, basophils, DCs, macrophages.
     - FcεRII (low affinity) – B cells, regulates IgE & antigen presentation.

5. Case Example 1 – Food Allergy
   - Patient: 27yo male, allergic reaction after nuts.
   - Diagnosis:
     - In-vitro specific IgE testing (almonds positive, peanuts negative).
     - Skin prick testing.
     - Clinical history essential.
   - Features of IgE-mediated reactions:
     - Rapid onset (seconds–minutes).
     - Reproducible upon re-exposure.
     - Clinical signs: urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, hypotension.

6. Testing for IgE
   - Methods:
     - RIA (1967), ImmunoCAP (sandwich immunoassay, widely used), luminescent
       immunoassays, nephelometry.
   - Quality checks: Calibration curves every 28 days, curve controls per run.
   - Basophil Activation Test (BAT):
     - Flow cytometry after allergen stimulation.
     - Highly specific but tedious and superseded by simpler methods.

7. Case Example 2 – Non-Specific Symptoms
   - Patient: 38yo male, lethargy, gut discomfort, negative standard tests.
   - Findings: Doctor ordered IgG food panel.
   - Assessment: Unlikely IgE-mediated allergy; vague symptoms; IgG test not
     clinically valid.

8. IgG Testing – Problems
   - IgG to foods is common in healthy individuals.
   - Lacks biological plausibility as marker of disease.
   - In immunotherapy: Conversion of IgE → IgG is positive, indicating tolerance.
   - Dried blood testing: Technically feasible but interpretation of IgG results is flawed.

9. Evaluating Pathology Tests
   - Ask:
     - Does it measure the analyte in vivo?
     - Is the result linked to disease?
     - Does it add new, useful info?
     - Is it cost-effective?

10. Dubious / Non-Validated Tests
    - Live blood analysis
    - Salivary hormone tests
    - Functional pathology tests
    - Clot retraction tests
    - Digestive stool analysis
    - Hair analysis (toxins, minerals)
    - Blood type testing (for diets)
    - Unvalidated cancer markers
    - Cytotoxic testing
    - Misuse of conventional tests

11. Misuse of Conventional Tests
    - Specific IgE:
      - False positives common.
      - Misinterpreted low levels may cause unnecessary food restrictions.
      - Used inappropriately in children with inhalant allergies → risk of malnutrition.
      - Raw data misrepresentation.

# Pathogenesis and Biomarkers of Common Autoimmune Diseases and Cancers

## Systematic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE, Commonly called Lupus)

- Pathogenesis
  - **Autoimmunity**: Loss of self-tolerance → immune system attacks host tissues.
  - **Genetic factors**: HLA-DR2, HLA-DR3, complement deficiencies (C1q, C2, C4) increase susceptibility.
  - **Environmental triggers**: UV light, certain drugs, infections trigger disease flares.
  - **Hormonal influences**: Higher prevalence in females; estrogen plays a role.
  - **Immune dysregulation**:
    - B cell hyperactivity → excessive autoantibody production (e.g., anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm).
    - T cell abnormalities → defective regulation of B cells.
    - Immune complex formation → deposits in tissues (skin, kidneys, joints).
    - Complement activation → inflammation and tissue injury.
  - **Key mechanism**: Type III hypersensitivity (immune complex–mediated) and some Type II hypersensitivity reactions.

- Biomarkers
  - Autoantibodies:
    - ANA (antinuclear antibody) – screening test; high sensitivity, low specificity.
    - Anti-dsDNA – specific for SLE; correlates with disease activity, especially nephritis.
    - Anti-Sm (Smith antigen) – highly specific, low sensitivity.
    - Anti-Ro/SSA, Anti-La/SSB – associated with cutaneous lupus, neonatal lupus.
    - Antiphospholipid antibodies – risk of thrombosis, pregnancy loss.
  - Complement levels:
    - Low C3 and C4 → active disease, especially lupus nephritis.
  - Inflammatory markers:
    - ESR ↑ (often), CRP may be normal unless there is serositis/infection.
  - Urinary markers:
    - Proteinuria, cellular casts in lupus nephritis.
  - Novel / emerging biomarkers:
    - Anti-C1q antibodies, urinary MCP-1, type I interferon signature.

## Melanoma

- Pathogenesis
  - Origin: Malignant tumor of melanocytes (pigment-producing cells in the skin).
  - Major risk factors:
    - UV radiation exposure (especially intermittent, intense sunburns).
    - Fair skin, light hair, freckling.
    - Multiple or atypical moles (dysplastic nevi).
    - Family history of melanoma.
  - Genetic mutations:
    - BRAF (esp. V600E) – common in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas.
    - NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, GNA11 mutations (depending on subtype).
    - CDKN2A mutations in familial melanoma syndromes.
  - Molecular mechanisms:
    - DNA damage from UV → mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors.
    - Dysregulation of cell cycle (loss of p16, abnormal MAPK pathway activation).
    - Immune evasion by tumor cells.
  - Progression:
    - Begins as radial growth phase (intraepidermal).
    - Progresses to vertical growth phase → dermal invasion → metastasis.

- Biomarkers
  - Histopathological markers:
    - S-100 protein – highly sensitive for melanoma.
    - HMB-45 – melanocyte-specific, used in immunohistochemistry.
    - Melan-A (MART-1) – melanocytic marker.
    - SOX10 – sensitive marker for melanocytic differentiation.
  - Molecular markers:
    - BRAF V600E mutation – predictive for response to BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib).
    - KIT mutations – seen in acral/mucosal melanomas; respond to imatinib in some cases.
    - NRAS mutations – potential target for MEK inhibitors.
  - Prognostic markers:
    - Breslow thickness – depth of invasion; most important prognostic factor.
    - Ulceration – poorer prognosis.
    - Mitotic rate – higher rate indicates aggressive disease.
    - LDH – elevated in advanced/metastatic melanoma; poor prognosis.
  - Emerging biomarkers:
    - PD-L1 expression – may predict immunotherapy response.
    - Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) – under study for monitoring.

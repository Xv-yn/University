# Biomarkers

A biomarker is defined as follows:

"A **defined characteristic** that is measured and evaluated by as an indicator of
normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or responses to an exposure or
therapeutic intervention"

**Defined Characteristic** - A specific characteristic that can be determined
numerically or otherwise.

A biomarker links a characteristic to a specific health measurement.

In simpler terms, a biomarker is something that we can use to determine how healthy or
unhealthy a person is.

For example, a hot forehead is not a biomarker BUT having a forehead temperature of 39
degrees Celcius is a biomarker when using it to determine if someone has a fever.

Another example would be the exact blood glucose level in blood (XX mL) to determine if
someone has diabetes.

In the literal sense, biomarkers can be (but not limited to):

- Proteins (e.g., PSA for prostate cancer)
- Genes / DNA mutations (e.g., BRCA1 for breast cancer)
- RNA expression (e.g., mRNA signatures)
- Metabolites (e.g., glucose for diabetes)
- Cells (e.g., circulating tumor cells)
- Imaging findings (e.g., PET scan uptake in tumors)

## Categories of Biomarkers

> [!Note]
> Not all biomarkers fall under just one category, a biomarker can fall under multiple
> categories.
> E.g. A biomarker can be both diagnostic and prognostic (depending on circumstance)

- **Diagnostic**
  - "Do you have the disease?"
  - Detects or confirms the presence of a disease; needs to be measured precisely,
    reliably, repeatedly at low cost
  - e.g troponin in blood for heart attack.
- **Prognostic**
  - "How bad is the disease? What might happen?"
  - Describes the recurrence or disease progression
  - e.g high HER2 receptor positivity in breast cancer.
- **Predictive**
  - "Will this person respond to treatment? Or get this disease?"
  - Presence or change predicts an individual to have a likely favourable or
    unfavourable effect
  - e.g high HbA1c levels predicts advancement to diabetes.
- **Monitoring Response**
  - "Is the treatment working?"
  - Biomarker that is measured serially to assess the status of the disease for
    evidence of exposure,
    or to detect an effect of a product/agent
  - e.g monitoring blood pressure when being treated with
    drugs for hypertension;
  - When level of the biomarker changes with exposure to agent/therapy;
  - e.g expected blood glucose level decrease as a response to diabetes treatment
- **Safety**
  - "Is this treatment harming the patient?"
  - That is measured before or after an intervention to indicate extent of toxicity,
    adverse event
  - e.g serum lead levels for lead exposure; urinary cotinine levels to indicate
    nicotine (cigarette smoke) exposure
- **Susceptibility**
  - "Are you at risk of getting the disease?"
  - Biomarker that indicates the potential to develop a disease (who currently does
    not have the condition)
  - e.g elevated LDL as a risk for developing coronary artery disease

## Examples of Biomarkers

### Immunologial Biomarkers

- Serum Cytokines
  - small proteins involved in cell signalling
- Chemokines
  - chemotactic cytokines that help in movement of cells
- Soluble receptors
  - shed from the cells
- Activation markers
  - correlating with function of the immune cells

### Biomarkers for Allergies

- Type 2 immune response cells involved basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, T-cells,
  epithelial cells, DC
  - cytokines IL-4,5,9,13,31; plasma CCL27; (asthma)
- Gene signatures
  - inform targeting IL-4 using IL-4Ra Dupilumab

### Biomarkers for Cancer

- Melanoma moles; IHC melan A;
- Prognostic markers (for metastasis)
  - Tumour size, Lymph nodes involved, Stage, Grade
- Diagnostic markers
  - Blood CEA, PSA, alpha-feto protein, CA125

## What makes a good biomarker?

There are many kinds of biomarkers, some unique to each person, some that only exist in
a small minority of people, etc. The best biomarkers meet the following requirements:

- Safe/ easy to measure
- Cost-effective to follow up / test
- Low false positive rate
- Consistent across gender/ ethnic groups

## Translating a biomarker into a clinical application

Phases of development

1. Preclinical exploratory
2. Clinical assay
3. Validation
4. Control and extensive testing

- Must have the potential to answer an important clinical question and change clinical
  practice
- High standard of accuracy; practical to sample
- Measurable in a medium-high throughput manner in a time efficient manner
- Able to be standardised, validated with certified assays, accredited labs
- Acceptable to scientists, health care providers, patients to adopt
- Regulatory, governance approvals

## Ethical

- Ethical: beneficence, (overall population level benefits) non-maleficence, (false
  results, invasive diagnostics) justice, (ensure steps are in place to follow through
  from screening; equality/equity) autonomy (understanding consequence of participation)
- Economic: value for money
- Legal: standards in testing, accreditation qualification of tests; confidentiality,
  avoid discrimination, informed consent
- Social: knowledge of condition, treatment, perception (of sensitivity/susceptibility),
  stigma, socio-economic, socio-demographic factors

## Diagnosis vs screening

Screening test is to detect earlu dissease or risk factors for a disease.

- To test how good a screening test is, we use a confusion matrix
- BRCA Test -> I am at a high risk of breast cancer BUT DO NOT HAVE IT

Diagnotic test is used to establish the presence or absence of a disease

- Highly Specific
- Cancer Lump -> I have cancer

## Sensitivity vs Specificity

Sensitivity - is the ability of the test to detect all those with disease in the
screened population.
Expressed as a % of those with disease correctly identified by a positive test

- How many can it idendify

Specificity - is the ability of the test to identify correctly those free of a disease
in the screened population.
Expressed as a % of those without disease correctly identified by a negative test

- How correct are the identifications

## Checkpoint Inhibition

- Checkpoints = Brakes
- Induce Negative signalling in T cells; Need to block the checkpoints with antibodies
  = checkpoint inhibition
- Simply put: Checkpoint Inhibitors are drugs that search for a specific protein that
  is produced due to the existence of a specifc cancer gene (doesn't have to be a
  cancer gene) and binds to that protein to neutralize it (make that protein useless)
- E.g:
  - PD1/PDL1 axis
  - Anti-PD1 antibodies have shown great success

## Digital Biomarkers

- DBx: a characteristic (or characteristics) collected from digital health technologies
  that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes

- DBfx: digital fingerprint/ footprint: an impression or unique signature of a defined
  healthcare characteristic, made by the integration of various digital biomarkers

## Immunohistochemistry

- Detection of proteins in tissues : “see” the protein in a spatial context within tissue
  architecture
- Antigen detection using- Antibody conjugated to an enzyme or fluorescent molecule
- E.g Biopsy in cancer diagnosis

1. Prepare the tissue
2. Add a primary antibody
3. Add a secondary antibody
4. Add a substrate + chromogen
5. View under a microscope
   - The stained areas tell you:
     - Where the protein is
     - How much is present (intensity)
     - Which cell types express it

## Western Blotting

- Detection of proteins from cell lysates- separation and identification by gel electrophoresis
  based on molecular weight
- Confirmatory test
- E.g HIV, mad cow disease

1. Run proteins on a gel (SDS-PAGE) → separates by size.
2. Transfer proteins from the gel to a membrane (blotting).
3. Block the membrane to prevent nonspecific binding.
4. Add primary antibody → binds your target protein.
5. Add secondary antibody (enzyme-linked) → binds primary.
6. Add substrate → light or color appears at the spot where your protein is.

## ELISA

- Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay – detects an anylate in a liquid protein/ligands in a liquid/
  secreted using antibodies
- Quantitate amount - using a spectrophotometer – to detect a reporter
- E.g Presence of antigens/ antibody in blood against pathogens/ hormones

1. Coat plate with a capture antibody specific to your target.
2. Add sample (e.g., blood) → If the target antigen is present, it binds.
3. Add a detection antibody that sticks to the antigen.
4. Add enzyme-linked secondary antibody → binds the detection antibody.
5. Add substrate → Enzyme reacts → color change!
6. Measure the color with a plate reader → more color = more target protein.

## Molecular Diagnostic Assays

- Molecular biological – DNA, RNA, miRNA
- cytogenetic
- Sequencing, mutation testing, copy number variations
- PCR (allele specific) , qPCR, microarray (gene expression patterns)
- Exome, transcriptome, omics, network (KEGG)
- Single cell NGS
- Liquid biopsies – Ct DNA, ct tumour cells

1. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
   - Amplifies a specific DNA sequence.
   - Detects presence of pathogens (e.g., COVID, HPV).
   - Quantitative PCR (qPCR) can measure how much is there.
2. RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription PCR)
   - Converts RNA → DNA, then amplifies.
   - Used for RNA viruses like COVID-19, HIV.
3. Isothermal Amplification (e.g., LAMP)
   - Works like PCR but at a constant temperature.
   - Faster, simpler setup.
4. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
   - Reads entire genomes or gene panels.
   - Can identify mutations, variants, or gene expression patterns.

## Flow Cytometry

- Cells labelled with fluorescent markers-
- Cell surface protein- bound to antibody conjugated to fluorophore
- Fluorescence detected by lasers and excitation of the fluorophore
- Used to detect proteins (which/how much)
- E.g blood cancer’ phenotyping different immune cells / immunological diagnostics

1. Label the cells with fluorescent dyes or antibodies
2. Inject the sample into the flow cytometer
3. Laser hits each cell
4. Detectors measure light signals
5. Computer converts light into data

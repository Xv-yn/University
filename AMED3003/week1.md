# Biomarkers

"A **defined characteristic** that is measured and evaluated by as an indicator of normal biological
processes, pathogenic processes or responses to an exposure or therapeutic intervention"

**Defined Characteristic** - A specific characteristic that can be determined numerically or otherwise.

Simply put it says: measuring a biological factor that can tell us something about the state of the
human body.

It can be derived from molecular, histologic, radiographic or physiological characteristics; blood,
urine, tissues can be measured.

A biomarker links a characteristic to a specific health measurement.

Literally, Biomarkers can be:

- Proteins (e.g., PSA for prostate cancer)
- Genes / DNA mutations (e.g., BRCA1 for breast cancer)
- RNA expression (e.g., mRNA signatures)
- Metabolites (e.g., glucose for diabetes)
- Cells (e.g., circulating tumor cells)
- Imaging findings (e.g., PET scan uptake in tumors)

## Categories of Biomarkers

> [!note]
> Not all biomarkers fall under just one category, a biomarker can fall under multiple categories

- Diagnostic Biomarkers
  - "Do you have the disease?"
  - Detects or confirms the presence of a disease; needs to be measured precisely, reliably,
    repeatedly at low cost
  - e.g troponin in blood for heart attack.
- Prognostic
  - "How bad is the disease? What might happen?"
  - Describes the recurrence or disease progression
  - e.g high HER2 receptor positivity in breast cancer.
- Predictive
  - "Will this person respond to treatment? Or get this disease?"
  - Presence or change predicts an individual to have a likely favourable or unfavourable effect
  - e.g high HbA1c levels predicts advancement to diabetes.
- Monitoring Response
  - "Is the treatment working?"
  - Biomarker that is measured serially to assess the status of the disease for evidence of exposure,
    or to detect an effect of a product/agent
  - e.g monitoring blood pressure when being treated with
    drugs for hypertension;
  - When level of the biomarker changes with exposure to agent/therapy;
  - e.g expected blood glucose level decrease as a response to diabetes treatment
- Safety
  - "Is this treatment harming the patient?"
  - That is measured before or after an intervention to indicate extent of toxicity, adverse event
  - e.g serum lead levels for lead exposure; urinary cotinine levels to indicate nicotine (cigarette
    smoke) exposure
- Susceptibility
  - "Are you at risk of getting the disease?"
  - Biomarker that indicates the potential to develop a disease (who currently does not have the
    condition)
  - e.g elevated LDL as a risk for developing coronary artery disease

## What makes a good biomarker?

- Safe/ easy to measure
- Cost-effective to follow up / test
- Low false positive rate
- Consistent across gender/ ethnic groups

## How to detect Biomarkers

These are the common methods to detect biomarkers:

- Blood Tests / Liquid Biopsy
- Immunoassays (ELISA)
- PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
- Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
- Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
- Mass Spectrometry (MS)
- Flow Cytometry

## Immunologial Biomarkers

- Serum Cytokines – small proteins involved in cell signalling
- Chemokines – chemotactic cytokines that help in movement of cells
- Soluble receptors – shed from the cells
- Activation markers – correlating with function of the immune cells

## Biomarkers for Allergies

- Type 2 immune response- cells involved basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, T-cells,
  epithelial cells, DC; cytokines IL-4,5,9,13,31; plasma CCL27; (asthma)
- Gene signatures- inform targeting IL-4 using IL-4Ra Dupilumab
- Omics-based research to study response to treatment being carried out currently

## Biomarkers for Cancer

> [!note]
> Melanoma moles; IHC melan A;

- Prognostic markers (for metastasis)
  - Tumour size, Lymph nodes involved, Stage, Grade
- Diagnostic markers
  - Blood CEA, PSA, alpha-feto protein, CA125;

## Checkpoint Inhibition

- Checkpoints = Brakes
- Induce Negative signalling in T cells; Need to block the checkpoints with antibodies = checkpoint
  inhibition
- Simply put: Checkpoint Inhibitors are drugs that search for a specific protein that is produced due
  to the existence of a specifc cancer gene (doesn't have to be a cancer gene) and binds to that
  protein to neutralize it (make that protein useless)
- E.g:
  - PD1/PDL1 axis
  - Anti-PD1 antibodies have shown great success

## Biomarkers for response to immunotherapy for Melanoma - checkpoint inhibition

For Melanoma

- High ligand e.g PD-L1 expression
- CD8 score
- Tumour mutations

## Translating a biomarker into a clinical application

Phases of development

1. Preclinical exploratory
2. Clinical assay
3. Validation
4. Control and extensive testing

- Must have the potential to answer an important clinical question and change clinical practice
- High standard of accuracy; practical to sample
- Measurable in a medium-high throughput manner in a time efficient manner
- Able to be standardised, validated with certified assays, accredited labs
- Acceptable to scientists, health care providers, patients to adopt
- Regulatory, governance approvals

## Digital Biomarkers

- DBx: a characteristic (or characteristics) collected from digital health technologies that is
  measured as an indicator of normal biological processes

- DBfx: digital fingerprint/ footprint: an impression or unique signature of a defined
  healthcare characteristic, made by the integration of various digital biomarkers

## Ethical

- Ethical: beneficence, (overall population level benefits) non-maleficence, (false results, invasive
  diagnostics) justice, (ensure steps are in place to follow through from screening; equality/equity)
  autonomy (understanding consequence of participation)
- Economic: value for money
- Legal: standards in testing, accreditation qualification of tests; confidentiality, avoid discrimination,
  informed consent
- Social: knowledge of condition, treatment, perception (of sensitivity/susceptibility), stigma, socio-
  economic, socio-demographic factors

## Diagnosis vs screening

Screening test is to detect earlu dissease or risk factors for a disease.

- To test how good a screening test is, we use a confusion matrix
- BRCA Test -> I am at a high risk of breast cancer BUT DO NOT HAVE IT

Diagnotic test is used to establish the presence or absence of a disease

- Highly Specific
- Cancer Lump -> I have cancer

## Sensitivity vs Specificity

Sensitivity - is the ability of the test to detect all those with disease in the screened population.
Expressed as a % of those with disease correctly identified by a positive test

- How many can it idendify

Specificity - is the ability of the test to identify correctly those free of a disease in the
screened population. Expressed as a % of those without disease correctly identified by a
negative test

- How correct are the identifications

## Diagnostic Assays

- 2D, 3D, fluidics, microfluidics
- Microscopy
- Immunohistochemistry/ tissue
- Spectrometry
- Bioactivity : Absorbance, fluorescence
- Western blotting
- Molecular Diagnostic Assays

## Imaging Modalities

- Computed Tomography
- X-ray / radiography (gamma rays)
- MRI- magnetic resonance imaging
- Nuclear medicine

- PET – positron emission tomography

## Flow Cytometry

- Fluidics based detection of properties of cells
- Cells labelled with fluorescent markers-
- Cell surface protein- bound to antibody conjugated to fluorophore
- Fluorescence detected by lasers and excitation of the fluorophore
- Used to detect proteins (which/how much)
- E.g blood cancer’ phenotyping different immune cells / immunological diagnostics

1. Label the cells with fluorescent dyes or antibodies
2. Inject the sample into the flow cytometer
3. Laser hits each cell
4. Detectors measure light signals
5. Computer converts light into data

## ELISA

- Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay – detects an anylate in a liquid protein/ligands in a liquid/
  secreted using antibodies
- Quantitate amount - using a spectrophotometer – to detect a reporter
- E.g Presence of antigens/ antibody in blood against pathogens/ hormones

1. Coat plate with a capture antibody specific to your target.
2. Add sample (e.g., blood) → If the target antigen is present, it binds.
3. Add a detection antibody that sticks to the antigen.
4. Add enzyme-linked secondary antibody → binds the detection antibody.
5. Add substrate → Enzyme reacts → color change!
6. Measure the color with a plate reader → more color = more target protein.

## Immunohistochemistry

- Detection of proteins in tissues : “see” the protein in a spatial context within tissue
  architecture
- Antigen detection using- Antibody conjugated to an enzyme or fluorescent molecule
- E.g Biopsy in cancer diagnosis

1. Prepare the tissue
2. Add a primary antibody
3. Add a secondary antibody
4. Add a substrate + chromogen
5. View under a microscope
   - The stained areas tell you:
     - Where the protein is
     - How much is present (intensity)
     - Which cell types express it

## Western Blotting

- Detection of proteins from cell lysates- separation and identification by gel electrophoresis
  based on molecular weight
- Confirmatory test
- E.g HIV, mad cow disease

1. Run proteins on a gel (SDS-PAGE) → separates by size.
2. Transfer proteins from the gel to a membrane (blotting).
3. Block the membrane to prevent nonspecific binding.
4. Add primary antibody → binds your target protein.
5. Add secondary antibody (enzyme-linked) → binds primary.
6. Add substrate → light or color appears at the spot where your protein is.

## Molecular Diagnostic Assays

- Molecular biological – DNA, RNA, miRNA
- cytogenetic
- Sequencing, mutation testing, copy number variations
- PCR (allele specific) , qPCR, microarray (gene expression patterns)
- Exome, transcriptome, omics, network (KEGG)
- Single cell NGS
- Liquid biopsies – Ct DNA, ct tumour cells

1. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
   - Amplifies a specific DNA sequence.
   - Detects presence of pathogens (e.g., COVID, HPV).
   - Quantitative PCR (qPCR) can measure how much is there.
2. RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription PCR)
   - Converts RNA → DNA, then amplifies.
   - Used for RNA viruses like COVID-19, HIV.
3. Isothermal Amplification (e.g., LAMP)
   - Works like PCR but at a constant temperature.
   - Faster, simpler setup.
4. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
   - Reads entire genomes or gene panels.
   - Can identify mutations, variants, or gene expression patterns.

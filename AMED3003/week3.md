# Imaging in Diagnostics

## Basic Physics of Ionising and Non-Ionising Imaging Techniques.

- Ionising Radiation
  - Definition: Radiation with enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, creating
    ions.
  - Physics:
    - High-energy electromagnetic waves (X-rays, γ-rays, some UV).
    - Photon energy > ~10 eV is sufficient to ionise atoms.
    - Can cause direct ionisation (ejecting electrons) or indirect ionisation (free radical
      formation, damaging DNA).
  - Imaging modalities (electron-based):
    - X-rays (plain films)
    - CT (Computed Tomography)
    - Mammography
    - Nuclear medicine (PET, SPECT, scintigraphy)
    - Fluoroscopy / angiography
  - Biological effects:
    - Direct: Cell/tissue death, burns, hair loss, bowel inflammation.
    - Indirect: DNA mutations, free radical damage, cancer risk.
    - Effects can be deterministic (dose-dependent, e.g. burns) or stochastic (probability
      increases with dose, e.g. cancer).
  - Key principle:
    - ALARA – “As Low As Reasonably Achievable” (minimise exposure).
    - Causes electron interactions (X-ray, CT, nuclear medicine) → powerful but risk of DNA damage.

- Non-Ionising Radiation
  - Definition: Radiation that does not have enough energy to ionise atoms (cannot eject electrons).
  - Physics:
    - Lower-energy part of the spectrum (radio, microwave, infrared, visible light, part of UV).
    - Transfers energy mainly as heat or through resonance (vibration/rotation of molecules).
  - Imaging modalities (proton or sound-based):
    - MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):
      - Uses strong magnetic fields + radiofrequency pulses.
      - Excites hydrogen nuclei (protons) in the body → signals detected → image formed.
      - No ionisation involved.
    - Ultrasound:
      - Uses high-frequency sound waves (not electromagnetic at all).
      - Echoes from tissues used to form images.
  - Biological effects:
    - No ionisation, but still thermal or mechanical effects possible:
    - MRI → tissue heating (SAR limits).
    - Ultrasound → cavitation or heating in sensitive tissues.

- Electromagnetic Spectrum Context
  - Ionising radiation = γ-rays, X-rays, some UV.
  - Non-ionising radiation = visible light, infrared, microwaves, radio waves, MRI RF waves,
    ultrasound (mechanical, not EM).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of MRI, CT, Ultrasound, X-Ray, and DSA for Diagnostic Imaging

### X-Rays (Plain Films)

**What it is**: Uses ionising radiation (X-rays) to produce 2D images.

**What it measures**: Tissue density and absorption of X-rays.

**How it works**: X-rays are generated in a vacuum tube → pass through the body → denser tissues (bone,
metal) absorb more and appear white, air appears black, soft tissues grey → detector/film records the
pattern.

Advantages:

- Quick, cheap, widely available.
- Good for bone, metal, and air patterns (lungs, bowel).
- Low radiation dose compared to CT.

Disadvantages:

- Uses ionising radiation.
- Limited detail for soft tissues (brain, solid organs, muscles).
- Only 2D projection, overlapping structures can obscure findings.

### CT (Computed Tomography)

**What it is**: Advanced X-ray technique producing cross-sectional (3D) images.

**What it measures**: Degree of X-ray attenuation by different tissues.

**How it works**: An X-ray tube rotates around the patient → multiple images from different angles →
computer reconstructs into slices. Can use contrast agents for vessels or soft tissue enhancement.

Advantages:

- Excellent spatial resolution (good detail).
- Fast → great in trauma/emergency settings.
- Good for bone, acute blood, lung disease, stroke, tumours, and vascular imaging (with contrast).
- Cross-sectional, avoids superimposed structures.

Disadvantages:

- Higher radiation dose than X-rays.
- Not great for some soft tissue lesions (esp. in brain white matter).
- Can produce metallic artefacts.
- Contrast reactions (iodine) possible.

### MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)

**What it is**: Non-ionising imaging that uses magnetic fields and radiofrequency waves.

**What it measures**: Signals from protons (mainly hydrogen in water and fat) when aligned and then
released from a magnetic field.

**How it works**: Patient placed in strong magnet → protons align with magnetic field → radiofrequency
pulses knock them out of alignment → as they relax back, they emit signals detected and converted into
images. Different sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR) highlight different tissues.

Advantages:

- Non-ionising (uses magnetic fields + radio waves).
- Outstanding soft tissue contrast → brain, spinal cord, joints, tumours.
- Multiple sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, contrast) for different tissue characterisation.
- No bone artefacts like CT.

Disadvantages:

- Expensive, less available, slower than CT.
- Safety concerns with metal (pacemakers, implants, shrapnel).
- Claustrophobic for patients.
- Motion artefacts (patient must stay very still).
- Not good for acute trauma in unstable patients (too slow).

### Ultrasound

**What it is**: Non-ionising imaging using high-frequency sound waves.

**What it measures**: Reflected echoes from tissue interfaces (density differences).

**How it works**: A transducer emits sound waves → echoes bounce back differently depending on tissue
type (fluid, soft tissue, bone) → computer constructs real-time image. Often used for pregnancy, heart
(echocardiography), abdomen, vessels (Doppler).

Advantages:

- No ionising radiation (safe in pregnancy & children).
- Cheap, quick, portable, can be done at bedside.
- Good for soft tissue, fluid-filled structures, foetus.
- Real-time imaging → useful for guiding procedures (biopsies, line placement, injections).

Disadvantages:

- Operator-dependent (skill of user affects image quality).
- Poor penetration through bone and air → not good for lungs, bowel, or inside skull.
- Limited in obese/large patients.
- Can cause minor tissue heating at high power.

### DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography)

**What it is**: X-ray technique focused on blood vessels.

**What it measures**: Flow of contrast medium in blood vessels.

**How it works**: Iodine contrast injected into vessels → X-ray images taken before and after
injection → computer subtracts background structures → only vessels remain visible → used for
aneurysms, blockages, interventional procedures.

Advantages:

- Gold standard for vascular imaging (arteries/veins).
- Very high spatial and temporal resolution.
- Allows both diagnosis and treatment (e.g. stenting, embolisation, clot removal).
- Dynamic (real-time blood flow visualisation).

Disadvantages:

- Invasive → requires catheter insertion into blood vessel.
- Uses ionising radiation (higher dose than CT angiography).
- Requires iodinated contrast (risk of allergy, kidney injury).
- Expensive, not widely available outside tertiary centres.
- Risk of complications (bleeding, vessel injury, stroke).

### Long-term Impacts of Ionising Radiation on Patients

Deterministic (Direct) Effects

- Dose-dependent severity: The higher the dose, the more severe the outcome.
- Effects include:
  - Skin burns, ulcers, hair loss
  - Cataracts (lens damage)
  - Infertility (reproductive organ damage)
  - Bone marrow suppression → immune system compromise
  - Foetal malformations if exposure occurs during pregnancy

Stochastic (Indirect) Effects

- Random in nature, not dose-dependent in severity, but risk increases with dose.
- Effects include:
  - Cancer: thyroid, breast, colon, lung, brain, stomach
  - Blood cancers: leukemia, lymphoma
  - Childhood cancers (especially with in-utero exposure)
  - Genetic mutations passed to future generations

Organ-Specific Long-Term Sensitivity

- Eyes: Cataracts months or years later
- Thyroid: Highly sensitive to radioactive iodine → thyroid cancer risk, especially in children
- Lungs: Vulnerable to DNA damage from inhaled radioactive particles
- Stomach & intestines: Risk if radioactive material ingested
- Reproductive organs: Sterility, inherited genetic mutations
- Bone marrow: Leukemia and immune system diseases

> [!NOTE]
> There is an issue when comparing evidence from Atomic Bomb Survivors

Evidence from Atomic Bomb Survivors

- Hiroshima and Nagasaki studies show:
  - Increased acute radiation sickness (bone marrow and colon damage)
  - Leukemia surge in the first decade after exposure (early onset effect)
  - Solid cancers (thyroid, breast, lung, colon) peaking 10–20 years later, persisting up to 40 years
  - Children at exposure had higher risk of long-term cancers
  - Lowest radiation dose linked to cancer increase: ~100 mGy

Overall, risk of fatal cancer rises by ~10% per Sv

> [!NOTE]
> Different dose patterns:
>
> - Atomic bomb survivors were exposed to one very large, acute dose.
> - Patients in medical imaging receive smaller, recurrent doses spread over time.
>
> Local vs whole-body exposure:
>
> - Bomb survivors experienced whole-body irradiation.
> - Medical procedures (e.g. CT scans, X-rays, radiotherapy) generally target specific body regions.
>
> DNA repair ability:
>
> - Cells can often repair small, single-strand breaks from low-dose exposure.
> - Repair is less effective after very large exposures.
>
> Risk adjustment:
>
> - Original estimates suggested ~10% increased fatal cancer risk per Sv (based on Japanese data).
> - Modern evidence suggests this is halved to ~5%/Sv when doses are given in smaller fractions.
>
> Age effects:
>
> - Children: 2–3× higher risk, as their tissues are more radiosensitive and they have longer lifespans for cancer to develop.
> - Elderly: Lower relative risk due to reduced lifespan and slower cell turnover.

### Background vs Medical vs Catastrophic Exposure

Background radiation: ~2.8–3.0 mSv per year globally (radon, cosmic rays, food, medical exposure).

Medical exposure: CT scans, X-rays, radiotherapy add significantly to dose.

Catastrophic exposure: Atomic bomb survivors, Chernobyl, Fukushima – much higher cancer rates and
genetic effects.

Principle of safety: ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) – minimise exposure, balance risk vs
benefit in medical imaging.

### Long-Term Patient Implications

Cancer development: Major concern, decades after exposure.

Cardiovascular disease: Evidence of radiation-induced heart and vessel damage.

Immune suppression: Ongoing risk of infections.

Quality of life: Cataracts, infertility, bowel disorders.

Psychological impact: Fear of cancer, stigma, mental health burden in survivors.

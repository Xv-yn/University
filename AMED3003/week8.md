# Rapid Screening & Gene Therapy for Spinal Muscular Atrophy

## Clinical Characteristics of SMA

Definition: Genetic neuromuscular disease caused by loss of the SMN1 gene, leading to insufficient
Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein.

Incidence: ~1 in 10,000 live births.

Pathology: Progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord.

Symptoms:

- Muscle weakness & atrophy
- Hypotonia
- Scoliosis and joint contractures
- Breathing and feeding difficulties

Phenotypic spectrum:

- Type 0: Prenatal onset, severe, no milestones, <6 months life expectancy.
- Type 1: Onset <6 months, never sits, life expectancy <2 years (~60%).
- Type 2: Onset 6–18 months, sits but cannot stand, >2 years (~27%).
- Type 3: Onset >18 months, stands/walks, normal lifespan (~12%).
- Type 4: Adult onset, mild progressive weakness, normal lifespan (~1%).

## Exercise: Modes of Inheritance

Autosomal Recessive (e.g., SMA): requires 2 mutated alleles.

Autosomal Dominant: requires 1 mutated allele.

X-linked Recessive: males need 1 mutated allele; females require 2.

Pedigrees: Used to predict risk of disease in offspring. Exercises in slides involve calculating
recurrence risks (e.g., Lynch syndrome, Aicardi-Goutières, Duchenne MD)

## Diagnosis / Testing

Family history: first step in assessing inheritance pattern.

Genetic basis:

- SMN1 deletions or mutations → disease onset.
- SMN2 is a pseudogene copy that modifies disease severity depending on copy number.

Newborn Screening (NBS): performed at 48–72 hours after birth.

- SMN1 copy number by qPCR.
- SMN1 & SMN2 copy number by ddPCR.

Eligibility for therapy:

- 0× SMN1, ≤ 3× SMN2 = eligible for gene therapy

## Exercise: Analysis of qPCR Data

Plot qPCR curves: amplify SMN1 & SMN2 with probes, alongside reference gene (CFTR).

Calculate copy numbers:

- Use ΔCq = (Cq gene of interest – Cq reference).
- Use ΔΔCq = (ΔCq patient – ΔCq control).
- Fold-change = 2^-ΔΔCq.

Interpretation:

- Compare fold-change to control to estimate copy number of SMN1/SMN2.

Determine SMA type based on SMN2 copy number distribution:

- 1 – 2 copies → likely Type 1.
- 3 copies → Type 2.
- 3 – 4 copies → Type 3.
- ≥ 4 copies → Type 4.

Gene therapy eligibility: Patients with SMN1 loss and ≤3 copies of SMN2

## SMA Therapies

Gene Therapy

- Zolgensma (Onasemnogene abeparvovec)
  - AAV9 vector delivers SMN1 cDNA.
  - Single IV dose.
  - Used for presymptomatic and symptomatic SMA with 1–3 SMN2 copies.

SMN2-Targeted Therapies

- Spinraza (Nusinersen, ASO): intrathecal injection, blocks splicing silencer motifs, improves
  SMN2 splicing.
- Evrysdi (Risdiplam, small molecule): oral daily, alters pre-mRNA conformation to boost SMN2
  splicing.
- Impact:
  - Improve motor, bulbar, respiratory function.
  - Some presymptomatically treated children show no signs of disease at 2 years

## More Complex Variants

Some alleles may not be straightforward SMN1/SMN2 copy number changes (e.g., hybrid alleles,
gene conversions).

PCR-based testing might show “normal” copy numbers, but allele configuration matters.

Complex allele combinations affect recurrence risk in families (exercises ask probability of
SMA in offspring depending on allele carriers)

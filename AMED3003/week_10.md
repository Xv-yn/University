# Process of Determining Normal Ranges for Biomarker Assays

Step 1: Choose a biomarker

- Must be clinically relevant, measurable, and add diagnostic or prognostic value beyond the clinical
  exam.
- Should be accessible and practical (e.g., blood test vs. brain biopsy)

Step 2: Select a healthy reference population

- Define “healthy” carefully — exclude participants with conditions or habits that could influence
  results.
- Exclusion criteria may include:
  - Medical conditions
  - Alcohol consumption
  - Abnormal body mass index (BMI)

Step 3: Choose the correct population subsets

- Reference ranges vary across biological subgroups, such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Pubertal stage
  - Pregnancy stage
  - Menstrual cycle stage

Step 4: Standardise measurement conditions

- Control pre-analytical variables:
  - Time of day (circadian variations)
  - Fasting vs. non-fasting state
  - Body position (lying vs. standing)
  - Medication use
- Control analytical variables:
  - Use the same assay method and instrument across samples

Step 5: Collect and analyse data

- Measure biomarker levels in all selected individuals.
- Calculate the central 95% reference interval, assuming a normal distribution (±2 SD from the mean).

For skewed data, use non-parametric methods or transformations rather than ± 2 SD

Step 6: Data cleaning and partitioning

- Remove outliers.
- If variability exists across subgroups (e.g. males vs females, different ages), partition and
  re-measure within each subset.

## Factors Influencing Normal Ranges

Biological factors

- Age, sex, hormonal status, pregnancy, menstrual phase, genetic background.

Lifestyle and health factors

- Diet, alcohol intake, physical activity, body composition.

Pre-analytical factors

- Time of day, fasting status, posture, medications.

Analytical factors

- Method of measurement, assay type, instrument calibration.

Population-specific differences

- Environmental or ethnic variations can shift the population average.

Statistical factors

- Skewed data or outliers may distort the mean and affect calculated limits.

## How Ranges Can Be Established and Skewed (Example)

Normal distribution (ideal)

- Most healthy individuals cluster around a central mean (μ), with 95% within ± 2 standard
  deviations (σ)

Skewed distributions

- Positively skewed: Tail to the right (e.g., triglycerides, ALP in children).
  - Mean > median > mode.
  - Cannot apply ± 2 SD rule — instead, use percentile-based reference intervals.
- Negatively skewed: Tail to the left (e.g., creatinine in older adults).
  - Mean < median < mode.

## Example: ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase)

Children and adolescents have higher ALP due to bone growth.

Levels differ by sex and age; therefore, a single “normal” range is inappropriate.

The reference table (page 18) partitions ALP into 18 categories (by age × sex), each with its own
range.

Without this partitioning, the combined data would appear positively skewed, making adults seem
“abnormal” when they’re not.

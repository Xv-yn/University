# How to handle NP-Complete Problems

Since polynomial-time solutions for NP-complete problems are unlikely, we 
must sacrifice at least one of:
- Optimality
- Generality
- Efficiency

Techniques:
- Approximation Algorithms (fast, non-optimal)
- Heuristics (practical but no guarantees)
- Exact Exponential-Time Algorithms
- Integer Linear Programming
- Solving restricted instances (e.g., trees, small solution size)
- Parameterized Algorithms (efficient for small parameter values)

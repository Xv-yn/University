# Machine Learning

There are 3 main types of computer learning:
- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Reinforcement

A fourth type (which is very old) is called association learning

## Supervised Learning

In a sense, its name is intuitive. The data that the model learns from must
be from an existing dataset. It doesn't learn from anything outside that
dataset.

And in most cases, that dataset is "supervised" by a human.

There are 2 main types of supervised learning:
- Classification
    - This is identifying something, like facial recognition, the MNIST 
      number thing
    - Usually categorical
- Regression
    - This is using past data to predict future data 
    - Usually numerical

## Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
Given a collection of data, we let the computer find ways to group them.
Points that generally "cluster" to a specific area can be grouped.


## Reinforcement Learning
This is basically smacking the computer everytimes it gives a bad output until
it learns to give a good output.

But instead of "smacking" its more like giving scores for specific outputs
and telling it to do better.

## Normalization

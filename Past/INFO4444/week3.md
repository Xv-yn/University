# Disruptive Innovation

The essence of disruptive innovation is basically creating a new market.

An example of this would be ChatGPT. Before ChatGPT, there was some 
really bad AI model, nothing normal. However, after the introduction of
3.5, it completely shifted the world's attitude towards it.

Now there are many competitors (DeepSeek, Copilot, etc.)

An with further discovery, it is a tool that can aid in all fiels.

## Low-End Disruption
In most cases, low-end distruption is the introduction of a cheaper product
that also meets many of the needs of the customer. 

As they get more customers, they start targeting the mainstream customers
and improve the quality of the product, while also starting to move towards
high end customers.

## New-Market Disruption

Same as ChatGPT, but another exmaple would be Netfilx.

Netflix started out at a video renting/distrbution company. They then moved
to streaming as a main service. As interest and customers picked up, they
started targeting mainstream customers and improving their product.

Due to their exponential growth in customers and profitability, it caused a
New-Market Distruption as they created a whole new market. Many other 
companies then adopted the same such as disney+, paramount, etc.

## Value Chains

A value chain is a concept that describes the full range of activities a 
company goes through to create a product or service and deliver it to 
customers.

In terms of Disruption, a company would determine which interal process(es) 
in the value chain that creates value for the product and expand and 
improve on that process(es)

## Innovators Dilemma

After they have established a foundation, the innovator would have to decide
if they should shift to high-end or low-end market. Either way, they will
have a change to get disrupted without any further improvement.
Should they choose high-end, there is the potential that someone will create
a cheaper and better alternative.
Simialarly, if they choose the low-end, there is the potential that someone
will create a more expensive, but much better alternative.

To solve the innovators dilemma, one can encourage firms to innovate while
also maintaining the existing business.

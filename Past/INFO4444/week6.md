# Open Data and Free & Open Source Software

## Open Data

This is data that anyone can freely access, use, modify and/or share for any
purpose. 

In summary, this is basically conducting a survey (hiding only personal
information like name and address) and releasing the data of the survey
such that anyone can access and use/download this data.

This is particularly useful for competitions like Kaggle, where open data
is shared and can be used by any individual to produce their own AI model.

Because this data can be viewed by anyone, due to it's transparency, it
allows for an innovation cycle:
1. Open Data
2. Community adds value
3. Data improves
4. Repeat From Step 2

## Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)

This is software that has the following 4 properties:
1. Can run the program for any purpose (for fun, for money, etc)
2. Can study the code source
3. Share copies
4. Improve adn distribute improvements

There exists free software such as antivirus and etc, but just because they
are free, does NOT mean that they are open source. 

Benefits of FOSS:
- Cost Saving
- Accelerates Development
- Encourages Development
- Fosters Community Innovatino

Monetization of FOSS:
- Dual Licensing (Free version adn paid version)
- Selling Support

## FOSS Licenses

1. MIT License
Do whatever you want. Just keep the license notice. Super flexible.

2. Apache 2.0
Same as MIT but stronger — adds patent protection 
(no one can sue you for using patented stuff in the code).

3. GPLv3 (General Public License)
Copyleft — If you modify the code and share it → You MUST 
release your source code too. Forces openness.

4. AGPLv3 (Affero GPL)
Same as GPLv3 but also applies to network usage (web apps, cloud services).

5. LGPLv3 (Lesser GPL)
Weaker Copyleft — applies only to libraries. If you link to this library 
you don’t have to share your code, unless you change the library itself.

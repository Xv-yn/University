# Platforms and Intellectual Property

## User Innovation

User innovation is different from product innovation. Instead of creating a
product (product innovation), this is basically having a user create or 
improve a product to meet their own needs.

Lets say the Apple Magic Mouse. People did not like the charging method, so
some individuals created a 3D print to make it more comfortable.

Afterwards, the users shared this and apple may learn from this in the future.

## Platforms

### Ecosystem

A Platform Ecosystem is defined as:

"A system where producers and consumers interact through a platform 
owner/provider."

An example of this would be the Apple Ecosystem -> App Store. Where there are
App developers who add to the Apple Ecosystem, and these user-made applications
increase the number of users in the apple ecosystem.

A well functioning platform requires a certian level of governance.
- A set of rules
- Network Effects - Value of the platform increases with more users e.g.
  more users = more people to chat with

### Sharing Economy

A socio-economic system based on sharing access to goods/services instead of
owning them.

This is confusing, but what it is is basically a platform where you can offer
your services. For example, in Uber, you can use your car to provide others
with transportation. 

It's like old netflix where you can rent a movie, but done online, and done
between individuals instead of company to individual.

## Intellectual Property

There are 6 main types and they protect specific things

1. Patent
    - Invention functionality

2. Trademark
    - Brand identity

3. Design
    - Product visual appearance

4. Copyright
    - Expression of idea

5. Trade Secret
    - Confidential business information

6. Circuit Layout
    - Circuit Design

# Exam Notes SUMMARY SO FAR

## Producer Innovation vs User Innovation

- Producer Innovation
    - Company makes products for user
    - Research and Development done by professionals
- User Innovation
    - User creates their own solution to problems
    - Users do this because companies don't meet their needs yet

## Roles within a Platform Ecosystem

- Producer
    - Makes things for the platform (App developers for the App Store)
- Consumer
    - User who downloads applications
- Provider
    - Platform Provider (The AppStore itself)
- Owner
    - Big Company (Apple)

## Benefits and Examples of the Sharing Economy

- Cheaper
- Builds trust

Examples:
- Uber
- Airbnb

## Intellectual Property

See above

## Examples of User Innovation

- Slack
- Apache Web Server

## Network Effects and Modularity

> The value of a product/platform increases as more people use it.

Positive Feedback Loop, using uber as an example:

Uber → More drivers → Faster rides → More customers → More drivers.

Modularity: 

Products are built from smaller interchangeable parts (modules).
- iPhone apps (add functionality without changing the whole phone).
